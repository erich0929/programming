              <p><a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/child-genius" title="">Channel 4's Child Genius</a>, which reaches
                its final episode on Sunday, reminds me a little of of
                Coach Trip. Admittedly, they're quite different on the
                surface – one is essentially <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/19/child-genius-documentary-filipa-jodelka" title="">a jumped-up, super-intelligent spelling
                bee</a>, and the other's just <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/feb/17/tv-coach-trip" title="">a load of idiots in replica football tops
                cooing at service stations</a> – but their
                similarities are numerous.</p>

              <p>They're both shows about people trying not to crack
                under pressure. They're both shows where, even if you
                manage to find a likable character, they're usually
                surrounded by people of varying states of
                reprehensibility. And, critically, the longer you
                survive on each show, the worse time you're bound to
                have.</p>

              <p>Just look at 11-year-old Eleanor, one of this year's
                finalists. She's a happy, bright girl who is in the
                middle of writing her first novel, but she desperately
                wants to win the Child Genius trophy. She wants to win
                so badly that her mother is pretty much willing her to
                lose at this point, because the toll that the
                competition is taking on her daughter is genuinely
                upsetting. In the past two episodes, the stress of
                spelling all kinds of polysyllabic scientific terms in
                front of an audience has pushed Eleanor to the edge of
                her emotional capacity. Watching her meltdown because
                she couldn't handle the pressure of the semi-final was
                bad enough; this week's she'll be playing to win. If
                she cracks again, it'll be incredibly hard to watch.</p>

              <p>Contrast her with Sophie, one of the contestants who
                was eliminated last week. She has been one of the most
                relaxed contestants when it comes to revision,
                preferring to take duckface selfies on her phone and
                coast on her natural ability rather than knuckle down
                and devote her entire life to the spelling of the word
                "septuagenarian". The contest doesn't really matter
                that much to her, and when she lost on Sunday her
                reaction was the astonishingly healthy: "I'm gonna go
                home and watch Dancing on Ice". Sophie might not reach
                the heady heights of the other Child Genius
                contestants, but at least she'll be happy.</p>

              <p>And that's what's most problematic about Child Genius.
                It's not the off-putting stench of Mensa. It's not the
                fact that it prizes parrot-like repetition over
                contextual knowledge. It's the fact that everyone
                taking part seems so miserable. Or worse, they're only
                miserable for the overwhelming majority of the time –
                each episode grants the contestants about one smile
                each, one moment of acting like a person their own age,
                before their parents smash an encyclopaedia down beside
                them and tell them that any time spent being happy is
                time that could be spent memorising the atomic weight
                of argon. Somehow knowing that these kids are actually
                kids, and not just autonomic information retention
                machines, makes the whole thing worse to sit through.</p>

              <p>Who will win on Sunday is anyone's guess – although
                my money's on Tudor, who looks the least fazed by the
                insane demands of his victory-obsessed parents – but
                what happens to them afterwards will be so much more
                interesting. I'd love to see a follow-up documentary
                about the finalists, or even a Seven Up-style series of
                documentaries about them, to see if they were able to
                transform their precocious intelligence into something
                more useful in the real world. Maybe they'll invent
                something that'll change the planet. Maybe they'll
                break down and drop out of society. Maybe they'll just
                go home and watch loads of Dancing on Ice. I really
                hope a lot of them just watch loads of Dancing on Ice.</p>

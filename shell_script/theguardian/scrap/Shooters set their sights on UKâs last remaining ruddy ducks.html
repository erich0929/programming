                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>It is American, oversexed and over here, but the
                    days of the <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/ruddyduck/">ruddy
                    duck in the UK</a> are finally numbered, with the
                    latest culling data revealing that just 10 females
                    remain.</p>

                  <p>The shooting of the final few – at about £3,000
                    a bird – will mark the end of half a century of
                    occupation by the species. At their peak, their
                    numbers reached 6,500 but their breeding prowess
                    threatened the native European white-headed duck.</p>

                  <p>The invasion began in 1948 when the famed
                    conservationist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Scott">Sir
                    Peter Scott’s</a> love for ducks led him to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/mar/08/1993-hasta-la-vista-ruddy-duck">import
                    three pairs of the colourful US birds</a> to his
                    Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire. But their
                    escape and consequent flourishing in the British
                    countryside led to an anguished debate among
                    ornithologists decades later, as well as a
                    nationwide cull that has cost more than £5m.</p>

                  <p>“It was a hugely difficult debate for the RSPB
                    and a very dark day when we had to concede [a cull]
                    was the only way forward,” said Grahame Madge, at
                    the bird charity. “But we stand up for
                    biodiversity internationally and sometimes you have
                    to make very hard decisions.” The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/08/ruddy-ducks-extermination">British
                    Birding Association wanted the cull to be
                    abandoned</a> and others have argued the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/10587001/Ruddy-duck-culls-to-cost-2400-per-bird.html">money
                    would be better spent</a> on other environmental
                    schemes.</p>

                  <p>The problem is that the “sexy” male ruddy
                    ducks (<em>Oxyura jamaicensis</em>) are preferred
                    by female white-headed ducks. The resulting hybrid
                    offspring threatened the survival of the
                    white-headed duck, which was already struggling
                    with habitat loss due to development. “Ruddy duck
                    males are particularly aggressive when it comes to
                    breeding and court females more vigorously,” said
                    Madge. “That makes them more attractive to female
                    white-headed ducks.”</p>

                  <p>The UK ruddy ducks also spread their wings across
                    Europe, into France, Belgium, the Netherlands and
                    into Spain. The discovery of hybrids in the latter
                    country in the 1990s showed the ducks had grown
                    into a continent-wide threat and that sealed their
                    fate. The following year, an eradication programme
                    began in the UK and a marksmen who has been part of
                    the cull since then told the Guardian the birds
                    fulfil the idea of a sitting duck.</p>

                  <p>“It’s not particularly difficult to shoot
                    them,” said the marksman, who works for the
                    government’s <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/science/managing-human-wildlife-conflict/non-native-species/">Animal
                    Health and Veterinary Laboratory Agency</a> (AHVLA)
                    but cannot be named due to the controversy
                    surrounding the cull. “They tend to be creatures
                    of habit, so we keep an eye on the most common
                    sites.”</p>

                  <p>The duck’s last hideouts are spread across the
                    UK, with one or two females known in most regions,
                    including the north-west, west and the south of
                    England and Northern Ireland. Landowners and
                    members of the public also provide tip-offs,
                    leading to dawn shoots with small-calibre rifles.</p>

                  <p>“The males are extremely distinctive,” said
                    the marksman, with their foxy feathers and a bright
                    blue bill. “The females less so, but over time
                    you get to know them and the way they swim. Their
                    cocked tail can be distinctive and the way the slip
                    very efficiently into the water when they dive,
                    with no splash.”</p>

                  <p>Sometimes the display call of the male is played
                    to encourage the birds out of the reeds in which
                    they like to rest. “The birds think ‘what is
                    that?’ and come out to investigate,” he said.</p>

                  <p>Overall, the cull has cost about £800 per bird,
                    but the great difficulty of chasing the last few
                    has tripled the cost, with more than <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-of-wildlife-culls-by-defra">£1m
                    spent in the last five years</a>. About 40 ruddy
                    ducks are left in total but the effort is being
                    focussed on the 10 females. A spokeswoman for the
                    Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
                    said a <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/nature/bern/default_en.asp">European
                    wildlife treaty</a> binds the UK to eradicating the
                    ruddy duck by the end of 2015. “We expect to
                    succeed,” she said.</p>

                  <p>The AHVLA marksman said: “It is certainly
                    doable, but it’s partly down to a bit of luck and
                    to siteowners giving us the access we need. I’m
                    keen to get the job done as quickly as possible.”</p>

                  <p>Hunting down the last few ruddy ducks and ending a
                    chapter in the UK’s ornithological history is
                    necessary, said Madge. “It’s not being
                    ruthless, it’s being careful and we want to be
                    spared that threat again,” he said, noting the
                    whole problem began with just a few birds. “It is
                    not a cause for celebration. It is a relief.”</p>

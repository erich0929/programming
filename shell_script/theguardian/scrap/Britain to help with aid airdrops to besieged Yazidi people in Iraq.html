                  <p>Britain will help drop aid to the besieged Yazidi
                    people in northern Iraq, the defence secretary,
                    Michael Fallon, has said after a meeting of the
                    Cobra emergency committee in London.</p>

                  <p>Planned humanitarian aid drops will include
                    British aid, including food water and emergency
                    supplies.</p>

                  <p>Fallon stressed Britain will not be involved in US
                    military strikes saying: “Our focus is on
                    assisting that humanitarian mission and using our
                    military in support of the Americans in terms of
                    refuelling and surveillance to underpin their
                    mission and to add to it with food drops of our
                    own. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“We welcome what the Americans are doing now to,
                    in particular to bring humanitarian relief, and to
                    prevent any further suffering.”</p>

                  <p>Earlier, David Cameron gave his backing to Barack
                    Obama’s decision to authorise limited air strikes
                    in northern Iraq. Downing Street has said the UK
                    will not be joining the US in military action,
                    after Obama announced an American campaign of aid
                    drops and possible air strikes. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>UK officials met in the Foreign Office on Thursday
                    night to discuss the issue and have been in touch
                    with the prime minister, who is on holiday in
                    Portugal. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Cameron said in a statement: “I am extremely
                    concerned by the appalling situation in Iraq and
                    the desperate situation facing hundreds of
                    thousands of Iraqis. And I utterly condemn the
                    barbaric attacks being waged by Isil terrorists
                    across the region.</p>

                  <p>“I am especially concerned for the minority
                    Yazidi community now trapped on Mount Sinjar, where
                    they have fled for their lives. They fear slaughter
                    if they descend back down the slopes but face
                    starvation and dehydration if they remain on the
                    mountain. The world must help them in their hour of
                    desperate need.”</p>

                  <p>He added: “Last night, the UK chaired a meeting
                    of the United Nations security council to ensure a
                    strong international response to the crisis and
                    this morning the defence secretary will chair a
                    Cobra [meeting] on the issue. I have tasked
                    officials to urgently establish what more we can do
                    to provide help to those affected, including those
                    in grave need of food, water and shelter in the
                    Sinjar area.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    “I welcome President Obama’s decision to accept
                    the Iraqi government’s request for help and to
                    conduct targeted US air strikes, if necessary, to
                    help Iraqi forces as they fight back against Isil
                    terrorists to free the civilians trapped on Mount
                    Sinjar. And I fully agree with the president that
                    we should stand up for the values we believe in –
                    the right to freedom and dignity, whatever your
                    religious beliefs.”</p>

                  <p>Cameron’s efforts to back military intervention
                    in Syria a year ago were rebuffed by the Commons
                    and so he will tread carefully before suggesting
                    any British military involvement. If there is any
                    such move he would be under pressure to recall
                    parliament, and some MPs will be concerned that
                    even limited humanitarian efforts could lead to
                    mission creep and a deeper involvement to stop
                    Isis. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Douglas
                    Alexander, said the government “should be
                    speaking up, speaking out, and acting quickly to
                    ensure that the international community does not
                    simply walk by on the other side as this
                    persecution increases”.</p>

                  <p>He added: “President Obama was right to
                    authorise limited air strikes to prevent the
                    slaughter of these terrified and vulnerable people,
                    and to support the humanitarian air drops of food
                    and water.</p>

                  <p> “The UK government has previously offered
                    urgent humanitarian aid to help support Iraq’s
                    people, and provided limited counter-terror
                    assistance to the Iraqi Government. Labour has
                    welcomed both these steps and would urge the UK
                    Government to continue to offer that assistance to
                    Iraq in the crucial days ahead.”</p>

                  <p>The chair of the intelligence and security select
                    committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, said he welcomed
                    the US air strikes.</p>

                  <p>He said: “What we are dealing with at the moment
                    – the purposes of today and the next few days –
                    is a specific humanitarian threat to 150,000
                    people, many of them on top of the mountain taken
                    refuge there in appalling conditions, and tens of
                    thousands that have fled elsewhere.</p>

                  <p>“It is a limited action that not only has the
                    approval of the Iraqi government and has been the
                    subject of the UN security council, and can make a
                    massive difference in saving lives.”</p>

                  <p> Rifkind condemned the Iraq invasion in 2003 as
                    “a foolish exercise that has caused massive
                    instability in Iraq, including a fundamental split
                    between the Sunni and Shia communities”. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Obama <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/obama-authorises-iraq-air-strikes-against-isis">said
                    in a late-night televised address</a> that military
                    planes had carried out humanitarian air drops in
                    the region, and America would take action if the
                    lives of its personnel in Iraq were at risk from
                    Islamist militants.</p>

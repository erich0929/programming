                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>There’s something of an original scripted
                    programming arms race going on right now, with each
                    stop on the cable dial trying to find its breakout
                    hit. Even Bravo, the home of every reality show you
                    hate to love, is trying its hand at <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/blogs/the-dish/bravos-first-scripted-series-premiering-in-2015">its
                    first scripted fare</a>. And as each channel is
                    trying to set itself apart, they’re all going for
                    the biggest lynchpin in the plan to become a home
                    for discerning viewers: the prestige drama.</p>

                  <p>Hey, AMC was a dumping ground for second-run
                    movies before Mad Men’s Emmy run turned them into
                    the place where everyone with a screenwriting
                    degree wanted to set up shop. Now they have The
                    Walking Dead, the highest-rated show on
                    television.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>That means that this summer some of the hottest
                    premieres are on channels you have never heard of,
                    don’t know where to find, or might not even get.
                    Here are five shows on smaller networks that
                    critics and other television cognoscenti want you
                    to love.<br/>

                  <h2>The Knick on Cinemax</h2>

                  <p>No, this is has nothing to do with buxom co-eds
                    having softcore sex at a bikini carwash.
                    “Skinemax” is officially dead and HBO’s
                    sister channel started its own originals in 2011
                    and had some success with Banshee last year. This
                    period drama directed by Steven Soderbergh is their
                    biggest stab (pun intended) at the limelight yet.
                    Clive Owen stars as an opium- and cocaine-addicted
                    surgeon at New York’s Knickerbocker Hospital at
                    the turn of the 20th century who has to battle his
                    demons and what would now be considered ghastly
                    medical practices while researching new techniques.
                    The show debuts on Friday night and so far reviews
                    have been rapturous. The good news is that if you
                    have HBO you might already get Cinemax and don’t
                    even know it.<br/>

                  <h2><strong>Outlander on Starz</strong></h2>

                  <p>That third premium movie channel has been trying
                    to get attention since they turned Oscar-winner
                    Crash into a series back in 2008. They launched the
                    Kelsey Grammer political drama Boss, the genius and
                    before-its-time comedy Party Down, and even the
                    delightfully pulptastic Spartacus. Outlander might
                    be the crossover hit they’ve been looking for.
                    This story of a second world war nurse (Caitriona
                    Balfe) who is transported back in time to medieval
                    Scotland is part sci-fi, part love story, and all
                    charm. If it can grow past its fangirl roots to
                    take hold in the culture at large, a lot of people
                    might be calling their cable provider to get Starz
                    on their bill every month.</p>

                  <p><strong>Manhattan on WGN America</strong><br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The problem with WGN America is that no one even
                    knows what the hell it is. It’s a
                    “superstation” that is essentially a nationally
                    syndicated version of Chicago’s WGN-TV which is
                    available in more than 70m homes (including yours,
                    probably). This period drama – why are they all
                    period dramas? – is about the families that move
                    to New Mexico in the 1940s to try to make the first
                    atomic bomb (codenamed the Manhattan project).
                    Heavily touted by critics, Manhattan <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140801-913211.html">tops
                    2 million viewers</a>, which is just a fraction of
                    those 70 million, but it’s a whole lot more than
                    Mad Men started out with.</p>

                  <h2><strong>The Honorable Woman on Sundance
                    TV</strong></h2>

                  <p>Now part of AMC Networks and no longer affiliated
                    with the film festival that gave it its name,
                    Sundance (who, full disclosure, employs my
                    boyfriend), has been on a bit of a roll since it
                    dipped its toe in the development waters. Its 2013
                    Jane Campion miniseries Top of the Lake won a
                    Golden Globe and its first original drama Rectify
                    was on many top 10 lists at the end of 2013. This
                    BBC co-production stars (Styled “Honourable
                    Woman” in the UK) Maggie Gyllenhaal as an Israeli
                    turned British politician whose personal life
                    becomes enmeshed in Middle Eastern intrigue. If the
                    twists aren’t enough for you to tune in, maybe
                    the clothes will be. This newspaper <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2014/jul/11/honourable-woman-most-stylish-show-on-tv-maggie-gyllenhaal">awarded
                    it the title</a> of the “most stylish show on
                    television”.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Sequestered on Crackle</strong></h2>

                  <p>No, silly, the candy bar is Krackle with a K.
                    Crackle is a streaming service. It’s the Betamax
                    to Hulu’s VHS. Crackle not only has some great
                    old shows (including all of Damages) but also a
                    handful of originals including the Jerry Seinfeld
                    vehicle (har har) Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.
                    Like many Crackle shows Sequestered features a
                    bunch of C-listers including Summer Glau and Jesse
                    Bradford (Swimfan, anyone?) and a jury that is, you
                    guessed it, sequestered. There’s also a murder
                    mystery where the governor’s son is the victim.
                    The jury will have to rule on the case if it wants
                    to get out of, you know, sequester. Jokes aside,
                    it’s not half bad. Maybe this Crackle thing is
                    the real future of original programming.</p>

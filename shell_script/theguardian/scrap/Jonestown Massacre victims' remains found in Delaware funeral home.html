                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Thirty-five years ago, funeral directors in
                    Delaware struggled to quickly bury and cremate the
                    remains of more than 900 people who died in a
                    suicide-murder in Jonestown, Guyana, many of them
                    Peoples Temple followers who drank cyanide-laced
                    punch.</p>

                  <p>Some bodies that arrived back in the US at Dover
                    Air Force Base in 1978 were claimed by families.
                    Some were cremated. Others were buried in a mass
                    grave in California.</p>

                  <p>On Thursday, officials revealed that not all had
                    been brought to a final resting place. The cremated
                    remains of nine Jonestown victims were discovered
                    in a decrepit, now-shuttered funeral home in Dover,
                    officials said. The discovery reopened wounds.</p>

                  <p>“All the survivors in touch with me are
                    traumatized because that door had been closed,”
                    said Jonestown survivor Laura Johnston Kohl, now a
                    retired teacher from San Diego.</p>

                  <p>“Whatever journey the ashes took in the US is
                    secondary. The first issue is how do we settle it
                    to make sure the ashes are where they belong ... at
                    Evergreen where everybody is,” she said,
                    referring to the cemetery that is the site of the
                    mass grave.</p>

                  <p>Hundreds of children and a US congressman died at
                    Jonestown, and 911 decomposing bodies were brought
                    to Dover Air Force Base, home to the US
                    military’s largest mortuary. The base has handled
                    mass casualties of both military personnel and
                    civilians from wars, the September 11 terrorist
                    attack on the Pentagon and the NASA Challenger and
                    Columbia space shuttle missions.</p>

                  <p>As the bodies were identified, the military asked
                    about a half-dozen local funeral homes to help the
                    families make arrangements.</p>

                  <p>Last week, though, the ashes of nine victims were
                    found neatly packaged and clearly marked, with the
                    names of the deceased and place of their death
                    included on accompanying death certificates, the
                    Delaware Division of Forensic Science said
                    Thursday. No names were released publicly because
                    relatives hadn’t been notified.</p>

                  <p>“It’s just so sad, for me as a survivor,”
                    said Yulanda Williams, 58, now a sergeant with the
                    San Francisco Police Department. Williams spent a
                    decade with the Peoples Temple, including three
                    months in Jonestown, named after the group’s
                    founder, Jim Jones. She left with her 8-month-old
                    daughter before the massacre.</p>

                  <p>“You consistently wind up finding yourself
                    trying to heal but having your wounds opened up
                    again when new information is given,” she said.</p>

                  <p>“We would do what they wanted, either cremation
                    or send the bodies back home. Most of them were
                    sent back home,” said funeral director William
                    Torbert Sr, 79.</p>

                  <p>Funeral directors say it is not uncommon for
                    family members to never retrieve cremated remains.</p>

                  <p>The Jonestown remains were found at the former
                    Minus Funeral Home after the property’s current
                    owner, a bank, called, according to Dover police
                    and public records. They also found 24 other
                    containers of marked, identified remains, and five
                    containers of remains they could not immediately
                    identify, said Kimberly Chandler, spokeswoman for
                    the Delaware Division of Forensic Science.</p>

                  <p>The dilapidated former funeral home in Dover had a
                    padlock on the double front doors. The building
                    showed few signs of its former use, although a
                    floral design was etched in glass panes at the
                    entrance. Dead vines hung from the building’s
                    white plaster walls, and cracked windows were
                    repaired with blue tape.</p>

                  <p>Jones ran the Peoples Temple in San Francisco in
                    the early 1970s. He founded a free health clinic
                    and a drug rehabilitation program, emerging as a
                    political force. But allegations of wrongdoing
                    mounted, and Jones moved the settlement to Guyana,
                    the only English-speaking country in South America.
                    Hundreds of followers moved.</p>

                  <p>On 18 November 1978, on a remote jungle airstrip,
                    gunmen from the group ambushed and killed US
                    Representative Leo Ryan of California, three
                    newsmen and a defector from the group. All were
                    visiting Jonestown on a fact-finding mission to
                    investigate reports of abuses of members.</p>

                  <p>Jones then orchestrated a ritual of mass murder
                    and suicide at the group’s nearby agricultural
                    commune, ordering followers to drink cyanide-laced
                    grape punch. Most complied, although survivors
                    described some people being shot, injected with
                    poison, or forced to drink the deadly beverage when
                    they tried to resist.</p>

                  <p>Many of the bodies were decomposed and could not
                    be identified. Several cemeteries refused to take
                    them until the Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland,
                    California, stepped forward in 1979 and accepted
                    409 bodies.</p>

                  <p>The remaining victims were cremated or buried in
                    family cemeteries over the period of several months
                    following the massacre.</p>

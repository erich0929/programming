              <p>"Is art evil? Is the internet dead? Why is everything
                so po-mo?" Standup comic <a href="http://www.caseyjaneellison.com" title="">Casey
                Jane Ellison</a> would like to know. She's pulling off
                a first with <a href="http://www.ovationtv.com/touching-the-art/" title="">Touching the Art</a>, an all-female, all-art
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy" title="More from the Guardian on Comedy">comedy</a>
                talk show. She set the tone from the off, taking on a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RGiwivKyag" title="">deadpan-bitchy persona</a> and joking that the
                show is "where we discuss the art world's least
                favourite subject: art". The show premiered on Ovation
                TV in July, but two episodes in, it's already clear
                that there's nothing else like it out there.</p>

              <p>The format is simple: with a trio of respected
                art-world guests, from New York Times critic Jori
                Finkel to photographer <a href="http://www.stephenfriedman.com/artists/catherine-opie/" title="">Catherine Opie</a> and founder of <a href="http://foryourart.com/" title="">ForYourArt.com</a> Bettina Korek, Ellison
                leads a debate on three topics, such as art and gender,
                or the art market. Cumbersome questions pile up: why
                can't women artists sell their work properly? Is art
                better if the person making it is a celeb? A closing
                Lightning Round makes the panel answer a last and
                largely unanswerable question – What is art? or What
                is art worth? – in three words or less. "You're all
                wrong," is Ellison's invariable conclusion, riffing on
                the idea of the critic as know-it-all.</p>
              <span class="inline embed embed-media"> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="276" id="ytplayer-jxRyntpCKIc" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jxRyntpCKIc?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3" width="480"></iframe> </span>
              <p>What makes the show both painful and totally
                compelling is that it almost doesn't know what genre it
                is:&nbsp;this could be parody, performance art,
                standup, serious critique, or all of them at once. The
                disconnect between Ellison's head-shaking,
                finger-wagging valley-girl persona and the panel's
                candidness is disconcerting. "Don't you think it's
                <em>so</em> funny how women artists can't sell their
                art?" she asks in episode one, then flicks her hair in
                Kardashian-like exasperation – "No, I know. Yes." –
                when Korek plainly doesn't find it amusing.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Ellison embodies every art-world-insider stereotype,
                feigning arrogance, boredom, nostril-flaring irritation
                and irony, while clad in all-black, down to her
                lipstick. But the questions are real, and the guests
                answer them sincerely. Their willingness to open up
                came as a real shock to Ellison: "These conversations
                happen constantly in private, but historically the art
                world has been less than eager to have them out in the
                open." This is why Touching the Art works: with the art
                world at times as opaque as the murky world of real
                estate, perhaps uncomfortable comedy is the only way
                in.</p>

              <p>To write the show, Ellison thinks of questions she's
                always wanted the answers to. The discussions so far
                have been awkward "because we pulled back the curtain a
                little", she explains. "Also, all the guests hate me
                – so that was awkward, too." An emerging artist as
                well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yW9tJJFXTk#t=218" title="">a comedian</a>, she brilliantly captures how
                stifling a world it can be, though both she and the
                show's creator, Shaw Bowman, emphasise that, above all,
                it aims to make the art world accessible, in a fun way.
                "One of the main goals was to reach not only people in
                the art world, but also people who might not care about
                art or even 'hate' it," says Ellison. "Honestly, many
                people in the art world 'hate' art, too."</p>

              <p>The show plays on that ambivalence. "We wanted to make
                Casey the butt of the joke," says Bowman, "not laugh at
                the art world. And everyone is clearly enjoying
                themselves. Casey is the obstinate character giving
                voice to anxieties around art."</p>

              <p>Obstinate she is, and it leads to some brilliant
                moments, like her constant passive-aggressive mentions
                of the fact that she feels no need to justify the
                show's gender bias: "We have an all-female panel
                joining us today." She squares up to the camera: "Is
                that an issue? Because we only have women on this show,
                and we don't really feel the need to discuss or defend
                that."</p>

              <p>The first two episodes were a pilot double bill, and
                the team is now regrouping to write the next
                instalments. Ellison wants to get out and about to
                cover big events – Art Basel, the Armory Show –
                beyond the studio. So watch this space: there's much
                more awkwardness to come.</p>

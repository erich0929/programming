                officials in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a> were
                standing firm on their demands and threatening to
                restart hostilities as the 72-hour ceasefire with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a>
                expired on Friday morning.</p>

              <p>The Palestinians declared that an Israeli-Egyptian
                blockade of Gaza must be lifted and about 100 prisoners
                held by Israel freed to secure a further truce. Israel
                insisted that Hamas must disarm, which officials from
                the Palestinian group said on Thursday was
                "inconceivable".</p>

              <p>As the ceasefire expired on Friday morning, Israel
                accused Hamas of breaking the truce by firing several
                rockets on Thursday night. A Hamas official, meanwhile,
                reiterated that the group could not agree to a further
                ceasefire unless Israel agreed in principle to end the
                border closure and allow the rebuilding of Gaza.</p>

              <p>The declarations by Hamas raise the prospect of a
                further bout of fighting in a conflict in which nearly
                1,900 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have died
                along with 64 Israeli soldiers. More than 3,000 rockets
                have been fired from Gaza into Israel in recent weeks.
                Most of those headed for inhabited areas were shot down
                but three civilians in Israel have been killed.</p>

              <p>Indirect talks brokered by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt" title="More from the Guardian on Egypt">Egypt</a>
                continued on Thursday as time ticked down. Statements
                in Gaza were echoed by members of the Palestinian
                negotiating team in Cairo. "If the Israelis don't agree
                we will go back and fight through the tunnels," one
                said.</p>

              <p>The discovery of dozens of tunnels between Gaza and
                Israel, which could be used to mount attacks to kill or
                kidnap civilians and soldiers, was cited as the main
                reason Israel sent ground forces into Gaza after days
                of aerial bombardment last month.</p>

              <p>The destruction of the tunnels discovered by Israeli
                troops was also given as the reason for ending the
                ground operation. The new threat, however, suggests
                further tunnels may exist.</p>

              <p>"All the scenarios are available. The Palestinian
                resistance continues and we will take actions depending
                on the results of the negotiations. If Israel does not
                respond to the demands of the Palestinian people, the
                Palestinian resistance can resume its activity," said
                the delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

              <p>The joint Palestinian delegation, formed from leaders
                of most Palestinian factions, was meeting Egyptian
                officials on Thursday night. The ceasefire was declared
                on Monday night, the latest in a series of attempts to
                halt the war.</p>

              <p>The gap between the demands of a Palestinian
                delegation, which includes Hamas, smaller factions and
                the Palestinian Authority, and those of Israel remains
                substantial.</p>

              <p>Israel is reluctant to lift the eight-year blockade of
                Gaza, the principal demand of Hamas, as it believes any
                substantial easing of restrictions could strengthen the
                Islamist organisation both politically and militarily.</p>

              <p>Ihab al-Ghussein, the deputy information minister of
                Hamas, said: "At 8am tomorrow our military brigades say
                they will continue the struggle if we do not get our
                demands. We have nothing to lose."</p>

              <p>Israeli officials said Hamas had rejected their offer
                to extend the ceasefire. Hamas did not confirm or deny
                the claim.</p>

              <p>In Gaza City on Thursday, Hamas and allied factions
                organised a rally in support of the Palestinian
                delegation in Cairo.</p>

              <p>Thousands listened to chants praising the Islamist
                organisation's military wings for their victories and
                to speeches calling for "victory in the political
                battle, as in the military battle".</p>

              <p>Though most in Gaza are supportive of Hamas, at least
                in public, a failure to secure any significant
                concessions in the talks could undermine its
                popularity.</p>

              <p>Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)
                of President <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-abbas" title="More from the Guardian on Mahmoud Abbas">Mahmoud
                Abbas</a> have been officially negotiating as one in
                Cairo.</p>

              <p>In April Hamas signed a unity agreement with the PLO,
                which is dominated by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/fatah" title="More from the Guardian on Fatah">Fatah</a>
                faction and has been at odds with Hamas for decades.
                The reconciliation saw the former rivals setting up a
                consensus government of independent technocrats that
                took office in June, ending seven years of separate
                administrations.</p>

              <p>In 2006 Hamas won Palestinian elections, taking de
                facto control of Gaza the following year. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu" title="More from the Guardian on Binyamin                 Netanyahu">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, the Israeli prime
                minister, has compared the group to Boko Haram, the
                Nigerian extremist movement, and the Islamic State
                (formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,
                or Isis), an al-Qaida splinter infamous for its
                brutality. Previously Netanyahu has refused to
                co-operate with the unity government because it
                included Hamas.</p>

              <p>One area offering some potential for agreement is the
                possible opening of the Egyptian border crossing into
                Gaza at Rafah.</p>

              <p>Israel wants Abbas's security forces to retake control
                of Gaza and deploy on the Palestinian side of the Rafah
                crossing, and for international aid to be disbursed
                through Abbas.</p>

              <p>Egypt has kept the Rafah crossing closed since the
                army's overthrow in July 2013 of the Islamist president
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi" title="More from the Guardian on Mohamed Morsi">Mohamed
                Morsi</a>, whose Muslim Brotherhood movement was a
                close ally of Hamas.</p>

              <p>Relations between Egypt and Hamas have collapsed since
                Morsi was ousted. The new regime in Egypt, one of only
                two Arab countries that have a peace treaty with
                Israel, says it has destroyed more than 1,600
                cross-border smuggling tunnels leading from Gaza into
                the Sinai peninsula.</p>

              <p>Israel has previously made some concessions on the
                blockade, easing restrictions on imports of food and
                construction materials in 2010 following the
                international outcry over a botched Israeli raid on a
                Gaza-bound flotilla, which left 10 Turks dead. Some
                restrictions were further eased after the last war
                between Hamas and Israel in Gaza in 2012.</p>

              <p>Ghussein, the Hamas minister, said: "We are not asking
                for miracles, just stopping the war, implementing past
                agreements, lifting the siege. We have to show support
                for our delegation and ask them to be firm about our
                demands. There will be no white flag."</p>

              <p>Up to 30% of Gaza's 1.8-million population has been
                displaced by the recent fighting and an estimated
                65,000 people are now homeless. About double that
                number are sheltering in UN schools converted to
                shelters during the war.</p>

              <p>The death toll in the conflict continues to rise as
                bodies are retrieved from ruined homes around Gaza.
                About 150 patients remain in intensive care, health
                officials say, out of 9,806 people treated. More than
                400 children have been killed.</p>

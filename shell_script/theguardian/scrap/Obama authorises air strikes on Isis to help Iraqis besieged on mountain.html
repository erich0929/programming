                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Barack Obama has authorised targeted air strikes
                    against Islamic militants in Iraq, as the US
                    military began an airborne operation to bring
                    relief to thousands of minority Iraqis driven to a
                    grim, mountain-top refuge.</p>

                  <p>Describing the threats against stranded Yazidi
                    refugees as holding the potential for
                    “genocide”, the president said he had
                    authorised limited air strikes to help Iraqi
                    forces, to assist in the fight to break the siege
                    and protect the civilians trapped there.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“When we face a situation like we do on that
                    mountain, with innocent people facing the prospect
                    of violence on a horrific scale and we have a
                    mandate to help - in this case a request from the
                    Iraqi government - and when we have unique
                    capabilities to act to avoid a massacre, I believe
                    the United States cannot turn a blind eye,” the
                    president said in a late-night statement from the
                    White House.</p>

                  <p>“Earlier this week, one Iraqi said no-one is
                    coming to help. Well, today America is coming to
                    help,” he said.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The delivery of humanitarian relief, in the form
                    of air drops by US jets, took place after a day of
                    intense debate at the White House over how to
                    respond to an Isis army that has caused mass
                    civilian displacement as it moves closer to the
                    previously stable Kurdistan region of Iraq.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The air drops represented the first aerial mission
                    over Iraq since 2011 for a purpose beyond
                    conducting surveillance on Isis, providing
                    long-scheduled military sales or transporting the
                    extra hundreds of US special operations
                    “advisers” that Obama ordered into Iraq to help
                    Baghdad confront the threat from Isis. They marked
                    the start of the deepest American engagement in
                    Iraq since US troops withdrew in late 2011 after
                    nearly a decade of war.</p>

                  <p>The US military was already helping the Iraqi
                    government co-ordinate air drops of vital supplies
                    to at least 40,000 Iraqis, mostly from the Yazidi
                    minority, trapped on top of Mount Sinjar in the
                    northwest of Iraq after death threats from the
                    Islamists who have overrun much of the region.</p>

                  <p>Iraqi and Kurdish officials on Friday said they
                    welcomed the air drops and authorisation of air
                    strikes. “We thank Barack Obama,” said Khalid
                    Jamal Alber, of the Kurdish religious affairs
                    ministry. “Kurdistan is the place for religious
                    minorities.”</p>

                  <p>Qaraqosh, Iraq’s largest Christian city, was
                    left all but abandoned as the jihadist group
                    Islamic State (Isis) advanced through minority
                    communities in the country’s north-west and
                    towards the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. Late on
                    Thursday night the UN security council condemned
                    the attacks and urged international support for the
                    Iraqi government.</p>

                  <p>Obama said “targeted air strikes” could soon
                    be used to protect American personnel in Irbil, and
                    could also be used to protect Baghdad if it came
                    under pressure. He claimed the steps were a
                    necessary response to a deteriorating humanitarian
                    situation, in which there were “chilling
                    reports” of mass executions and the enslavement
                    of Yazidi women.</p>

                  <p>“In recent days Yazidi women, men and children
                    from the region of Sinjar have fled for their
                    lives,” he said. “Thousands, perhaps tens of
                    thousands are now hiding high up the mountain with
                    little but the clothes on their backs, they are
                    without food, they are without water. People are
                    starving, children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile
                    Isis forces below have called for the systematic
                    destruction of the Yazidi people, which would
                    constitute genocide.”<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>UN officials say an estimated 200,000 new refugees
                    are seeking sanctuary in the Kurdish north from
                    Islamic extremists who have pursued them since the
                    weekend. Qaraqosh, south-east of Mosul and home to
                    around 50,000 Christians, was the latest to fall,
                    with most residents fleeing before dawn on Thursday
                    as convoys of extremists drew near.</p>

                  <p>Other Christian towns near Mosul, including Tel
                    Askof, Tel Keif and Qaramless, have also largely
                    been emptied. Those who remained behind were
                    reportedly given the same stark choice given to
                    other minorities, including Yazidis: flee, convert
                    to Islam or be killed.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Iraq_minorityTowns"> <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img                   src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1407502081483/Iraq_minorityTowns2.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe>
                  </figure>
                  <p>Iraqi troops have concentrated on defending
                    Baghdad and the Shia south, leaving the defence of
                    minorities in the north to the Kurdish peshmurga.
                    However, even the much vaunted Kurdish forces were
                    no match for the heavy weapons wielded by the
                    jihadists as they advanced in recent days.</p>

                  <p>Without any protection, Yazidis, Christians and
                    Turkmen are being uprooted from communities they
                    have lived in for millennia and the geo-social
                    fabric of Iraq is being rapidly shredded.</p>

                  <p>The Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk, Joseph Thomas,
                    described the situation in northern Iraq as
                    “catastrophic, a crisis beyond imagination”. He
                    demanded urgent intervention to save what remained
                    of the area’s Christian heritage.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Kurdish officials on Thursday demanded more help
                    in catering for refugees. The Kurdish administered
                    areas have seen staggering numbers cross their
                    notional border since the original Isis onslaught
                    two months ago. In the first week alone, some
                    500,000 people are thought to have fled towards
                    Irbil.</p>

                  <p>The capital of the Kurdish north is already home
                    to a new Chaldean Christian community, which fled
                    Baghdad in the wake of an Isis-led massacre inside
                    a cathedral in October 2010. Many fleeing
                    Christians have headed for the Ainkawa
                    neighbourhood, which is home to Baghdad’s
                    Christian exiles.</p>

                  <p>The past 11 years of war and insurrection since
                    the US invasion have led to most of Iraq’s
                    Christians fleeing. Numbers have plummeted starkly
                    from an estimated one million before 2003 to around
                    150,000 now. A large number of those who remain are
                    now displaced.</p>

                  <p>Isis has threatened to redraw the unitary borders
                    that were carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman
                    empire. The group’s rampant insurgency and the
                    inability of state actors to stop it has rendered
                    the frontier between Iraq and Syria evermore
                    irrelevant.</p>

                  <p>In the absence of central government authority,
                    Shia militias are taking dominant roles, amplifying
                    sectarian enmity between Islam’s two most
                    dominant sects.</p>

                  <p>Iraq’s beleaguered prime minister, Nouri
                    al-Maliki, no longer has the authority to unite the
                    country’s disparate sects. Maliki, a Shia Muslim,
                    had disenfranchised much of the country’s Sunni
                    community over the past three years, some of whom
                    have turned to Isis as a means of reasserting
                    themselves.</p>

                  <p>After digging in for the past two months, Maliki
                    now faces a desperate battle to form a government,
                    with his key backer Iran understood to have told
                    him that it no longer supports his bid to lead the
                    country for a third term.</p>

                  <p>Massoud Barazani, a Kurdish leader, has said he is
                    moving towards holding a referendum that could pave
                    the way for an independence bid, a move that could
                    spell the end of Iraq, and unsettle surrounding
                    countries, including Syria, Turkey and Iran.</p>

                  <p>The UN security council warned that the Isis
                    attacks could constitute crimes against humanity
                    and that those responsible should be held
                    accountable. “The members of the security council
                    also urge all parties to stop human rights
                    violations and abuses and ensure humanitarian
                    access and facilitate the delivery of assistance to
                    those fleeing the violence,” said Britain’s UN
                    ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, reading from a
                    statement after an emergency consultation requested
                    by France.</p>

                  <p>White House officials made clear the more
                    aggressive US posture was prompted by rapid Isil
                    advances on Irbil on Wednesday but insisted in a
                    conference call with reporters that Obama did not
                    anticipate a “sustained campaign” against what
                    they called a “sophisticated military force”.</p>

                  <p>There are already constant US air patrols over
                    Irbil but the US has no plans to evacuate diplomats
                    or military advisers in the city – believing it
                    can keep any further advances at bay with air power
                    alone.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>As of Thursday night there had been no offensive
                    air missions. The humanitarian mission involved C17
                    and C130 cargo planes dropping 5,300 gallons of
                    water and 8,000 ready meals (MREs) intended to
                    provide short-term assistance to 8,000 of the
                    “many thousands” of refugees thought to be
                    trapped on the mountain.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>US officials confirmed they were expecting a new
                    Iraqi prime minister to be appointed by Sunday,
                    suggesting the White House believes its
                    precondition for greater political unity in Iraq
                    before military intervention can take place may be
                    within sight.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The White House says it has been consulting with
                    the US Congress over its intervention but does not
                    believe it needs authorisation for military action
                    and merely plans to file a report under the war
                    powers act if air strikes go ahead. Obama’s
                    authorisation for the Pentagon to carry out attacks
                    is “geographically restricted to Iraq” and does
                    not include Syria.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>A Lockheed Martin factory in the US that
                    manufactures Hellfire air-to-ground missiles has
                    been operating seven days a week to provide weapons
                    destined for Iraqi government and Kurdish forces
                    under pre-existing support arrangements.</p>

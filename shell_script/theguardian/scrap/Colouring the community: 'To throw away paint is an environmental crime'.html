                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>It’s taken 40 litres of emulsion to basecoat the
                    walls. A further 260 litres is needed to paint the
                    murals, which will then be varnished. But the paint
                    comes free. It’s part of the 90 tons of waste
                    paint that a not-for-profit scheme, Bradford
                    Community RePaint collects each year.</p>

                  <p>In a Yorkshire subway, a team of artists are using
                    unwanted paint that may otherwise have been tipped
                    into landfill to create murals and stars with the
                    names of local Bradford celebrities – from the
                    Brontë sisters to boxers – in the Jacobs Well
                    and the National Media Museum subways.</p>

                  <p>Twelve walls show scenes with well-known people
                    and landmarks including Salts Mill, the Wool
                    Exchange and Bradford City Football Club. Bradford
                    City of Film will be celebrated with murals showing
                    highlights of 100 years of filming and a
                    red-painted floor will give it a showbiz look.</p>

                  <p>Karen Hutchinson, project manager for the <a href="http://www.bradrepaint.co.uk">Bradford
                    Community RePaint</a> scheme says: “Before we
                    came along, these areas were grotty and dull. The
                    team of artists, long-term unemployed people and
                    volunteers are showing what you can do with
                    unwanted paint, a product that’s so often
                    wasted.”</p>

                  <p>Bradford Community RePaint is one of the largest
                    organisations that forms part of a national
                    not-for-profit network called the <a href="http://www.communityrepaint.org.uk">Community
                    RePaint</a> network, which is, in turn, managed by
                    non-profit <a href="http://www.resourcefutures.co.uk">Resource
                    Futures</a>.</p>

                  <p>Each scheme works slightly differently but they
                    all collect donations of paint. Some collect it
                    from Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRC),
                    while others from the painting trade – end of
                    product ranges at DIY shops, for example – do
                    both. Each scheme then uses, redistributes or sells
                    the paint to community groups and individuals at
                    low cost.</p>

                  <p>As anyone who does their own decorating knows,
                    getting rid of leftover paint isn’t always
                    straightforward. You can take unwanted paint to
                    your local tip but there’s no legislation to say
                    that councils have to accept it. Most do but
                    disposing of it is problematic.</p>

                  <p>While HWRCs have to meet targets to reduce the
                    liquid that goes into landfill, budget cuts can
                    make incinerating paint – a typical method to get
                    rid of it – unaffordable. In fact, the situation
                    has led to people who take paint to HWRCs
                    occasionally being told to solidify it, by mixing
                    it with cat litter or sawdust, so it can then be
                    chucked into landfill.</p>

                  <p>Martin Pearse, manager of the Community RePaint
                    Network says: “Solidifying paint is not the
                    answer. Our research shows that of the 43m litres
                    that come into household waste recycling centres
                    each year, 28m litres of it is reusable. To throw
                    it away is an environmental crime.”</p>

                  <p>Instead, the Community RePaint Network works with
                    HWRCs and collects unwanted paint, from consumers
                    and the paint trade. Each of the 73 schemes runs
                    autonomously and varies in the way they sell or
                    redistribute the paint.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.reworkltd.org.uk/">Community
                    RePaint Bristol</a>, for example, sells the paint
                    to anyone who comes into its shop. For consumers,
                    it’s priced at £2 a litre. Charities and
                    community groups get it slightly cheaper.</p>

                  <p>The project also runs a furniture scheme, which
                    uses the paint. Volunteers as young as 12 years
                    old, many of whom are struggling in mainstream
                    education, work with a qualified carpenter to
                    upcycle quality pieces of furniture, such as <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Upcycled-red-nathan-sideboard-cabinet-bug-handles-/251397312237?pt=UK_Home_Garden_LivingRoomFurniture_EH&amp;hash=item3a88728eed">this
                    red Nathan sideboard</a>, painted in Rectory Red by
                    Farrow and Ball, sold on eBay and in the shop.</p>

                  <p>“We’ve had Victorian library tables, 1960s
                    sideboards, and a wardrobe that we recently turned
                    into a garden shed, which we call a Shedrobe,”
                    says Vicky Beckwith, chief executive of ReWork Ltd,
                    which runs the projects.</p>

                  <p>She says the upcycled end appeals to local
                    residents who want quirky pieces and helps raise
                    money.</p>

                  <p>Makala Campbell, a regular buyer says: “I love
                    it because it’s good for the environment and it
                    gives young people a chance. Every room in my house
                    is now kitted out with either their fab makes, or
                    something I got cheap and did up myself with their
                    advice.”</p>

                  <p>At other schemes, you need to be a low-income
                    household or community group to be eligible to buy
                    the paint. <a href="http://www.g2g.org.uk/community-repaint-bromley">Community
                    RePaint Bromley</a>, for example, sells two-litre
                    tins, which is enough to paint a small double
                    bedroom, to those on low incomes for £2.50 and if
                    you can’t do the decorating yourself, they can
                    sometimes help.</p>

                  <p>Community RePaint Bromley painted the kitchen of a
                    housing association tenant Mary Doughty, whose home
                    had been flooded, for instance. They got the paint
                    for free and provided the labour free of charge.
                    Doughty, a pensioner who has limited mobility,
                    says: “The volunteers washed down the walls and
                    repainted the whole room, they did the job quickly
                    and I was thrilled with the result.”</p>

                  <p>Future plans for Community RePaint, which is
                    sponsored by Dulux, include filtering and
                    repackaging unwanted paint into new tins and
                    potentially selling the paint in charity shops.</p>

                  <p>Pearse says: “Reusing unwanted paint solves
                    several key problems. However, it’s a big issue
                    and we know that we’re only touching the tip of
                    the iceberg.”</p>

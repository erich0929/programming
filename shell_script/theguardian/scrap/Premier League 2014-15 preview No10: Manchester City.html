                  <p>Manchester City now attempt to do what only
                    Manchester United and Chelsea have achieved: retain
                    the championship in the Premier League era.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>To help in this quest Manuel Pellegrini <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/bacary-sagna-manchester-city-arsenal-three-year-deal" title="">has acquired Bacary Sagna</a>, who can
                    play every position in defence, on a free transfer,
                    paid £12m for Porto’s Fernando to strengthen
                    central midfield, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/08/manchester-city-sign-willy-caballero-malaga" title="">brought in Willy Caballero from Málaga
                    for £6m</a> to offer serious competition for Joe

                  <p></p>

                  <p>City are pleased with this business considering
                    the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/16/manchester-city-fine-transfer-cap-uefa-ffp" title="">£49m net spend limitation imposed on them
                    by Uefa</a> due to their Financial Fair Play
                    irregularities. But the one player Pellegrini is to
                    splurge £32m on – and the manager really needs
                    – has led him a merry dance.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Porto’s Eliaquim Mangala could have signed in
                    January and might, again, have joined at the end of
                    last season. While City remain quietly confident he
                    will arrive – the word is that the deal might
                    have been completed earlier but there has been no
                    need to rush it through – as the third most
                    expensive signing in the club’s history, how
                    Mangala fares will be intriguing.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The 23-year-old is being bought to play alongside
                    Vincent Kompany in central defence. Martín
                    Demichelis was an important factor during City’s
                    title-winning run-in but his pace is suspect and at
                    33 – and after an arduous campaign playing in
                    Argentina’s run to the World Cup final – he is
                    past his best.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The concern with Mangala is how he might settle in
                    the Premier League. The Frenchman’s temperament
                    would be tested, and he did not kick a ball in
                    anger at the World Cup, and so is not yet an
                    established international. Also, Mangala would
                    hardly ride into City on a wave of enthusiasm,
                    having <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/19/eliaquim-mangala-manchester-city-chelsea" title="">previously publicly expressed a preference
                    for Chelsea</a>, as well as continually
                    prevaricating over the transfer.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The curious case of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/18/yaya-toure-manchester-city-contract-fans-psg-manchester-united-agent" title="">Yaya Touré and his missing birthday
                    cake</a> appears to have been solved, though maybe
                    only for the time being. The rumblings of
                    discontent from the Ivorian feel like they could
                    flare up again at any moment.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-978e28b7-6725-4f1b-9393-e4e1482337e2">

                  <p></p>

                  <p>While <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/06/manchester-city-frank-lampard-loan-new-york-chelsea" title="">Frank Lampard has been signed on a loan
                    deal</a> for half of the season, he is 36 and is no
                    straight replacement for the dynamic Touré. The
                    Englishman is helping to fill City’s home-grown
                    player quota of five in the reduced Champions
                    League squad of 21, another of the FFP punishments,
                    which are being characterised as hardly ideal but
                    no hindrance by the club as they should last for
                    only the coming campaign.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Regarding Lampard, Pellegrini says: “He knows we
                    have a very good team, we have a lot of players in
                    his position. He is one player more. We have a lot
                    of games particularly with the Champions League, so
                    he’s very important for our team.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Beyond these issues, though, City should enter the
                    new campaign in serene and highly confident mood.
                    Pellegrini added a second championship in three
                    years to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/02/manchester-city-sunderland-capital-one-cup-final-match-report" title="">Capital One Cup success</a> to repeat the
                    double achieved by José Mourinho in his first
                    season as Chelsea manager, in 2004-05.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The Chilean also took City into the Champions
                    League knockout stage for the first time meaning
                    his players’ experience of the competition has
                    broadened. Yet with this comes greater expectation
                    and Pellegrini will soon be fielding questions
                    about whether not winning the European Cup next
                    term will constitute a failure.</p>

                    Jesús Navas, Aleksandar Kolarov, Gaël Clichy, and
                    Demichelis, should be reaching the semi-finals, at
                    least.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Milner, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/23/james-milner-manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini" title="">whose future remains in doubt as he wants
                    greater first XI opportunities</a>, believes the
                    push to elevate the club further is on. “I
                    don’t like making predictions but we’ve got a
                    strong team, we’ve improved our squad, it’s
                    stronger,” he says. “The new guys are settling
                    in and once they do, we’ll be better for it. The
                    hunger is there. We want to go again because
                    we’ve had the taste of winning trophies. At one
                    point last season we were still in all four
                    trophies and pushing for each one. So we want to be
                    in that situation again and pushing for all of
                    them.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“City is a great club to be with and I just want
                    to contribute as much as I can. I played in
                    important games at the end of last season and it
                    was pleasing to help the team win trophies.
                    That’s what it’s all about – I want as many
                    minutes as I can. Competition is tough but when you
                    get out there you have to go and help the team. We
                    definitely have that at City, you test yourself
                    every single day in training. You want to improve,
                    you want to win trophies and think: ‘Did I become
                    the best player that I can?’</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“If you can’t improve playing with these guys
                    in the dressing room you are going to struggle
                    anyway.”</p>

                  <p>While City failed to reach the final of the
                    International Champions Cup where they would have
                    faced Manchester United last Monday, Milner
                    believes the team is primed for the upcoming
                    campaign. “Pre-season isn’t really a time any
                    player likes,” he says. “There’s not much of
                    a break after a World Cup. You need a rest but on
                    the other hand it doesn’t take you too much time
                    to get back in the swing of things.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“It’s all behind us now and we are focusing on
                    the new season. We know how hard it’s going to be
                    and we know how strong the other teams are and
                    they’ve strengthened again but it’s up to us to
                    go again and try to retain the title.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“It’ll be tight – it was very competitive
                    last year and I’m sure it will be close again.
                    It’s down to us to go out there and show we are
                    the [ones to] beat, I suppose.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>City have a great chance of emulating United and
                    Chelsea to win a consecutive Premier League title.
                    If Pellegrini’s band can finish above the London
                    side, they should do so.</p>

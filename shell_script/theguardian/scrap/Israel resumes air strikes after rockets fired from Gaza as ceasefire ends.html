                launched air strikes on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a> on
                Friday morning after Islamist groups there refused to
                extend a ceasefire and resumed rocket fire.</p>

              <p>At least 35 rockets were fired from Gaza towards
                Israel after a 72-hour ceasefire expired at 8am local
                time. Several more had been fired during the night.</p>

              <p>By noon there were reports of air strikes in the north
                and east of Gaza and several audible explosions in Gaza
                City. There appear to have been some casualties, though
                details were unclear.</p>

              <p>There were also reports of injuries in Israel from
                rocket strikes. At least one rocket appeared to have
                fallen short, landing in Gaza.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" title="More from the Guardian on Hamas">Hamas</a>
                spokesman Fawzi Barhum told the AFP news agency: "All
                the Palestinian factions, including Hamas, have agreed
                not to renew the ceasefire because [Israel] is refusing
                to accommodate our demands."</p>

              <p>An Israeli official said the prime minister, Binyamin
                Netanyahu, had ordered the military to "retaliate
                forcefully to the Hamas breach of the ceasefire". The
                Israeli army said it had targeted "terror sites" across
                the Gaza Strip, and no Israeli soldiers had entered the
                Palestinian territory.</p>

              <p>It is unclear whether Hamas or other smaller factions
                in Gaza, such as Islamic Jihad, fired the rockets at
                Israel.</p>

              <p>In Gaza, tens of thousands of people who had returned
                to their homes during the 72-hour ceasefire rushed back
                to the UN-run shelters where many have been staying
                since the war began more than four weeks ago.</p>

              <p>At one school, 800 people who had left in recent days
                returned on Friday morning as news of the renewed
                fighting broke. One was Nidal Sultan, 21, who had
                driven with six members of his family from the northern
                town of Beit Lahiya.</p>

              <p>"We were in the school on the first day of the
                ceasefire and came back this morning," he said. "There
                were strikes and shelling in the last hour or so. It's
                not safe, so we have to come to the school however bad
                it is. We will stay now until the war stops."</p>

              <p>UN worker Amal Zaqqout said the school was now holding
                more displaced people than before the ceasefire. "We
                are very, very crowded. We have 2,000 or more people
                living in corridors, in classrooms, everywhere. Thank
                God we have not had any transmissible diseases, but
                that is definitely a concern now," Zaqqout said.</p>

              <p>Before the ceasefire, more than a quarter of Gaza's
                population of 1.8 million had been displaced. About
                half were in UN shelters, and many of the rest stayed
                with relatives. About 65,000 are believed now to be
                homeless.</p>

              <p>Most people in Gaza blamed Israel for the renewal of
                hostilities and said they supported the demands made by
                the Palestinian delegation in Cairo during indirect
                negotiations brokered by the Egyptians in recent days.
                Chief among those demands has been the lifting of the
                eight-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt.</p>

              <p>"The people's demands are humanitarian. Even if the
                resistance agreed to drop the demands, the people would
                not agree. We are at the point where life or death is
                the same thing for us," said Mohamed Eid, 40, who has
                been living in the grounds of the main hospital in Gaza
                since his house was destroyed in fierce fighting in the
                east of the city 15 days ago.</p>

              <p>But Faiza Abu Khalil, 37, said she was "very worried
                and very scared" and still hoped for peace. Abu Khalil
                had returned to Gaza from her home near Beit Lahiya on
                Thursday night when it appeared the ceasefire would not
                hold.</p>

              <p>A representative of the Mujahideen Faction, a minor
                group in Gaza, told the Guardian that further
                "sacrifices" by the Palestinian people would lead to
                the end of the blockade. "The people of Gaza are not
                willing to live under siege," he said.</p>

              <p>More than 1,800 Palestinians have been killed and
                nearly 10,000 injured, the majority civilians, in the
                latest of three wars fought between Hamas and Israel
                since 2008. Three civilians have been killed by rocket
                fire from Gaza into Israel, and 64 Israeli soldiers
                were killed during ground operations that ended six
                days ago.</p>

              <p>The ceasefire, declared on Monday night, had brought a
                palpable sense of relief and optimism to Gaza, but on
                Friday streets were deserted once more and any shops
                that had opened were hastily bring down their shutters.</p>

              <p>Hamas officials in Gaza had threatened to restart
                hostilities if their demands were not met in the
                indirect negotiations with Israel that have continued
                in Cairo for most of the week.</p>

              <p>The Palestinian delegation in Cairo has demanded that
                the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza is lifted and
                about 100 prisoners held by Israel are freed to secure
                a further truce. Israel insists Hamas must disarm,
                which officials from the Palestinian group said on
                Thursday was "inconceivable".</p>

              <p>More than 3,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza into
                Israel in recent weeks. Most of those headed for
                inhabited areas were shot down. A surge in rocket fire
                from Gaza prompted Israel to launch air strikes almost
                a month ago.</p>

              <p>Statements by Hamas officials in Gaza were echoed by
                members of the Palestinian negotiating team in Cairo on
                Thursday. "If the Israelis don't agree, we will go back
                and fight through the tunnels," one said.</p>

              <p>The discovery of dozens of tunnels between Gaza and
                Israel, which could be used to mount attacks to kill or
                kidnap civilians and soldiers, was cited as the main
                reason Israel sent ground forces into Gaza after days
                of aerial bombardment last month.</p>

              <p>The destruction of the tunnels discovered by Israeli
                troops was also given as the reason for ending the
                ground operation. The new threat, however, suggests
                further tunnels may exist.</p>

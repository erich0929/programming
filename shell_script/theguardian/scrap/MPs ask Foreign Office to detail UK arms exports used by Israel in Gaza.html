              <p>The chair of the parliamentary select committees that
                oversee British arms exports has written to the foreign
                secretary requesting details of any military exports
                that may have been used by the Israeli army during its
                invasion of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/Arms-export-controls/2014-08-07-Philip-Hammond-Israel-export-licences.pdf" title="">In the letter</a> Sir John Stanley also asks
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond" title="More from the Guardian on Philip Hammond">Philip
                Hammond</a> for more details of the government's review
                of arm export licences, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/uk-government-reviews-arms-sales-israel-gaza" title="">which was announced this week</a>.</p>

              <p>The intervention will increase pressure on the
                government to halt arms sales to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a> and
                follows the resignation of the Foreign Office minister
                Sayeeda Warsi, who left the coalition over its failure
                to condemn the actions of Israel in Gaza and a call by
                the deputy prime minister, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg" title="More from the Guardian on Nick Clegg">Nick
                Clegg</a>, for an embargo.</p>

              <p>Stanley, who chairs the Commons committees on arms
                export controls, wants Hammond to release information
                about any "controlled goods, including components,
                technologies and software, that have received British
                government approval for export to Israel which the
                government has reason to believe may have been used by
                the Israelis in the course of Operation Protective Edge
                either from within Israel or in Gaza itself."</p>

              <p>Since 2010, UK arms export licences to Israel worth
                £42m have been granted to 131 British defence industry
                manufacturers. According to government documents, the
                equipment ranges from components for drones to military
                radars, targeting systems and electronic warfare
                equipment.</p>

              <p>The total value of dual-use export licences to Israel
                – which can be used for both commercial and military
                use – was worth about £8bn last year. The government
                says the vast bulk of this – about £7.75bn – is
                for commercial equipment, mostly cryptographic software
                to supply Israel's mobile phone networks.</p>

              <p>But Stanley now wants the government to spell out if
                any of this equipment may have been used in Israel's
                Operation Protective Edge.</p>

              <p>the former international development secretary <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell" title="More from the Guardian on Andrew                 Mitchell">Andrew Mitchell</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/06/israel-arms-embargo-andrew-mitchell-gaza" title="">became the most senior former government</a>
                minister to call for tougher action, warning that the
                level of misery and carnage in Gaza was likely to
                poison the remaining goodwill in the region for
                generations.</p>

              <p>Earlier this week campaigners staged a rooftop protest
                at a factory in Lichfield, which they claim supplies
                engines for drones being used in Gaza. Twelve anti-arms
                campaigners scaled the factory of UAV Engines on
                Tuesday, forcing it to close.</p>

              <p>Arms-control campaigners say that two UK companies –
                including UAV Engines – were given permission to
                supply components for the Hermes drones, which military
                experts say have been used in the war in Gaza.</p>

              <p>According to its website, UAV Engines, a subsidiary of
                the Israeli defence contractor Elbit, manufactures
                engines for "various size tactical UAV's [unmanned
                aerial vehicles], target drones and single-mission
                platforms".</p>

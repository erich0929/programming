              <h2>Welcome to the Guardian and Observer Digital Archive</h2>

              <p>Since 1791, the world's major events have been
                documented in the pages of the Guardian and the
                Observer. Today, that record of history is available
                online in the shape of the <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/guardian/advancedsearch.html">Guardian
                and Observer Digital Archive</a>.</p>

              <p>Access to the archive is flexible. You can sign up for
                just 24 hours or for a year and the fees are adjusted
                accordingly. Your money will give you access to:</p>

              <p>• 1.2 million replica pages of the Guardian and
                Observer dating back to 1791<br/>
                • Almost 13 million articles<br/>
                • 1000s of photographs</p>

              <p>From the battlefields of the Napoleonic Wars to the
                packed squares of the Arab spring; from the first
                Wimbledon final to London 2012; from JFK to the present
                day, for centuries the Guardian and Observer have been
                reporting on events that have shaped lives around the
                globe in their individual and distinctive voices.</p>

              <p>The new archive was relaunched on 15 November 2012,
                and houses almost 13 million articles dating from 1791
                up to 2003. It provides researchers, schools,
                universities and other institutions with an invaluable
                resource across many areas of interest, including world
                affairs, politics, sport, business, culture and
                science. But as well as the big moments in history, the
                records also mark milestones in people's personal
                lives; the archive includes birth and wedding
                announcements and obituaries. It also stores some
                classified ads, comics, pictures and graphics.</p>

                access the professional version of the archive <a href="http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/">here</a>.</p>

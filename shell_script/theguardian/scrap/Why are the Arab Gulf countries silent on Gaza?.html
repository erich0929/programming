                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>After hopes of a lasting truce fade again today,
                    the intense pressure on Gaza continues. We are used
                    to hearing voices across the world raised against
                    the conflict. But, perhaps surprisingly, the Gulf
                    has scarcely reared its head to protest.</p>

                  <p>Gulf thinking towards Gaza is mixed up. Upon
                    joining the ruler of Dubai’s central government
                    office in 2007, its Palestinian head of strategy
                    told me to steer clear of Palestinian politics.
                    “For Sheikh Mohammed, policy comes before
                    politics. We don’t put the cart before the horse.
                    We must get our house in order and then we can
                    change things.”</p>

                  <p>Her attitude, however, contrasted with the
                    material help being provided. “Palestinians have
                    received more humanitarian aid [in the form of
                    budget support] from the United Arab Emirates than
                    from any other nation. The UAE has always stood by
                    us,” the Palestinian Authority’s man in charge
                    of reconstruction told me in 2010.</p>

                  <p>True to form, through the latest period of
                    violence, <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/massive-aid-effort-by-uae-headed-for-gaza" title="">18 Boeing 747s and C130s were dispatched
                    from Dubai</a> laden with meals, blankets and
                    medicine. Saudi Arabia pledged US$80m (around
                    £48m) in aid. Yet this humanitarian effort stands
                    in stark contrast to Gulf foreign policy. Saudi
                    Arabia’s king took three painful weeks to even
                    criticise Israel’s offensive. The UAE then
                    concurred; its foreign minister, Abdullah bin
                    Zayed, had earlier condemned Israel on Twitter.</p>

                  <p>But not one concrete, punitive action against
                    Israel was called for by either country. That Gulf
                    Arab silence – in policy, thought and strategy
                    – has not gone unnoticed. It has reverberated in
                    the west, where Spain and Latin American nations
                    have done more to shore up support for Gaza than
                    their Arab counterparts.</p>

                  <p>Instead of taking action, Gulf nations aimed their
                    diplomatic guns at each other. A spat raged between
                    Qatar, Saudi and the UAE: the Middle East Eye <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/saudi-israeli-alliance-forged-blood-601611381" title="">depicted an Israel-Saudi-Egypt troika
                    conspiring against Gaza</a>. The UAE <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/qatar/uae-demands-apology-from-al-jazeera-over-gaza-report-1.1362331" title="">denied it had ever normalised relations
                    with Israel</a> “as others did” – a dig at
                    Qatar’s now defunct 1990s relationship with
                    Israel.</p>

                  <p>What are some of the reasons for this state of
                    affairs? Partly, fatigue has set in after a decade
                    of pressing the Gulf’s definitive position on
                    Israel, the Arab Peace Initiative, to little avail.
                    But domestic political concerns inevitably play a
                    part for regimes that are constantly wary of their
                    own populations.</p>

                  <p>As Dr Kristian Ulrichsen of Rice University has
                    said, “Gulf states are also caught in a difficult
                    balancing act as their commitment to the
                    Palestinian cause clashes with their campaign
                    against the Muslim Brotherhood across the
                    region”.</p>

                  <p>This may be the case. But it’s hard to see what
                    Gulf states could lose in the long term from a
                    resolution of this most divisive problem. If only
                    they attacked the problem of reaching a lasting
                    settlement with the same vigour they show in
                    attacking each other. The UAE has augmented its
                    standing at the UN with time, energy and resources.
                    In the interest of deterring Iran, the UAE now has
                    the world’s highest military spending per capita
                    at $14bn a year and Saudi Arabia outstrips the UAE
                    for defence imports. It is time to develop a
                    formula for Gulf Arab intervention backed by
                    diplomatic and defence credibility.</p>

                  <p>Aid is useless if reconstruction materials cannot
                    get through. The Gulf ought to pursue an end to the
                    blockade, in alignment with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/05/gaza-blockade-must-end-un-first-step-settlement" title="">Jimmy Carter’s and Mary Robinson’s
                    recent proposal</a> for a UN security council
                    resolution. Saudi Arabia and the UAE could either
                    pay for, send or politically back peacekeepers; the
                    precedent exists in Afghanistan alongside western
                    allies. The question of a UAE-funded <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/iron-dome-gaza-israel-air-defence-missile" title="">Iron Dome</a> to protect Gazans has not so
                    far been contemplated. It should be.</p>

                  <p>The US has said it will <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2014/08/230249.htm" title="">“strongly oppose” a Palestinian
                    push</a> for an investigation by the international
                    criminal court into Israeli actions. A credible
                    Arab plan to back efforts at the international
                    criminal court is overdue; Palestinians should not
                    be going it alone. The US-Gulf relationship should
                    also come under pressure as a result of the
                    former’s financial and military support for
                    Israel. Oil exports should not be off the
                    bargaining table.</p>

                  <p>This could be the Gulf’s smart-power moment. It
                    must use its influence where it is needed most.</p>

              <p>In the muggy summer heat of Moscow, a&nbsp;small crowd
                gathered outside the Meyerhold centre, a theatre that
                almost disappears between towering glass buildings that
                line the roads. The space itself may not be impressive,
                a dark and airless room five storeys up, but the drama
                is nothing short of an epic spectacle.</p>

              <p>The play is called The War, a simple but loaded title
                in the current political climate. Russian director and
                playwright Vladimir Pankov was commissioned by the
                director of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival" title="More from the Guardian on Edinburgh                 festival">Edinburgh festival</a>, Jonathan Mills, and
                the director of the Chekhov international theatre
                festival, Valery Shadrin, to create a play based around
                Russian experiences of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar" title="More from the Guardian on First world war">first
                world war</a>.</p>

              <p>Two years after the idea was first conceived, and
                following <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/first-world-war-ceremonies-testimony-power-reconciliation" title="">events to mark 100 years since the start of
                the war</a>, the play will make its debut at the
                Edinburgh festival on Saturday.</p>

              <p>After the first rehearsal in front of an audience came
                to a close, Pankov slumped in the windowless theatre
                cafe – it later emerged he had been awake for almost
                30 hours.</p>

              <p>"In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia" title="More from the Guardian on Russia">Russia</a>,
                there is a silence around world war one in drama, it is
                almost as if it has been forgotten or people are even
                afraid to tackle it," he said.</p>

              <p>"This is the peculiarity of the human consciousness,
                that people see things from event to event and of
                course the closest war to our generation is world war
                two. We know people who were in that war, touched by
                that war, but it is not the same for world war one. So
                when I was given this theme I started thinking about
                war in general. That's how the title came about.</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="The War" data-pin-description="Vladimir Pankov said that while the               characters in The War are Russian, their experiences are               universal." height="480" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407322230502/The-War-004.jpg" width="320"/> <span class="caption" style="width:               320px;"> Vladimir Pankov said that while the characters
              in The War are Russian, their experiences are universal.
              </span> </span>
              <p>"I even thought about what sounds does this word
                consist of and what does it mean to different nations."</p>

              <p>The opulent production, opens in Pairs in 1913 as a
                group of beautifully dressed artists, writers and poets
                gather beneath chandeliers and sing around a grand
                piano.</p>

              <p>As war tightens its grip on Russia, the play follows
                how three of the party – a pacifist who finds himself
                thrown into the frontline of battle, a war-hungry
                radical who is faced with the realities of war, and a
                father struggling with loss and devastation – are
                changed by the experiences of the conflict.</p>

              <p>Drawing on texts such as Homer's great epic, The
                Iliad, and Death of the Hero, the semi-fictional
                account of the first world war by British soldier
                Richard Aldington, Pankov said that while the
                characters were Russian, their stories were universal.</p>

              <p>"The material I used from accounts of soldiers from
                the era to contemporary accounts of war then going back
                to Homer's Iliad, showed me that, through the
                centuries, nothing had changed when you look at the
                human experience of war," he said.</p>

              <p>"So my question in putting this war on stage was: do
                human beings need war? Is it really so important to
                destroy everything, raze cities, communities and
                civilisations to the ground to start a new life? This
                is not a question for individuals – we direct it at
                governments or gods. They are not direct questions that
                are spoken aloud in the play but they are absolutely
                implicit."</p>

              <p>Discussing his use of a British text as a key source
                for the play (Pankov's protagonist even shares the name
                George with Aldington's hero) the director explained:
                "We realised that the world premiere would be in
                Edinburgh and we were looking for some material that
                would be well-known to a British audience, and it was
                more important that we could look at this material from
                the Russian point of view.</p>

              <p>"I don't see it in narrow terms that there was a
                Russian experience and a British experience in the war
                This play is here to talk to a person, an independent,
                human individual, not to a representative of a certain
                nation – that is what I am aiming at. In these terms,
                I am not staging the Russian experience or the British
                experience passing from one nation to another, it is
                the experience of people in the war in general. War and
                the pain of war does not distinguish between nations."</p>

              <p>At a time when hostility defines the relationship
                between Russia and Britain, the desire to sidestep
                nationality is perhaps understandable. While the play
                is part of the 2014 UK-Russian year of culture,
                approved last year by the-then foreign secretary,
                William Hague, last week the Foreign Office announced
                that "in light of the illegal annexation of Crimea by
                Russia, Her Majesty's government has withdrawn all
                ministerial and senior official involvement in the year
                of culture".</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="The War" data-pin-description="Pankov aims to recreate the sounds               of war using the soundrama technique." height="276" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407317797618/The-War-011.jpg" width="460"/> <span class="caption" style="width:               460px;"> Pankov aims to recreate the sounds of war using
              the soundrama technique. </span> </span>
              <p>Pankov is at pains to remove his play from the
                political fallout, despite acknowledging the subject is
                implicit in any discussion of war, past or present. "I
                am not on a mission here, I am not looking into digging
                into the historical truth," he said. "Any history is
                subject to interpretation. In this play I would like to
                talk directly to the heart of my audience. I don't
                think it makes sense to speak about politics, it
                creates conflict and we are back to war once again.
                Many people build their lives and careers on conflict
                and this is not the way I would like to go"</p>

              <p>Pankov's seeming unwillingness to court political
                controversy could be linked to the cultural climate of
                Russia. In April, the arts newspaper Kultura, building
                on a report by the ministry of culture, attacked modern
                Russian playwrights for "sleaze, obscenities,
                pornography … worthless shamanism disguised as
                innovation" and called for state funding to be cut on
                "everything that corrupts the viewer, drives him into
                depression, kills living sensations in a man, creates
                the image of Russia as a dull and hopeless country".</p>

              <p>Pankov said: "The play is called The War, so I realise
                that it is political in itself. But I would say no, it
                is not the time to emphasise this political element. We
                are not living in good times and I do worry that an
                English [sic] audience will bring their preconceptions
                of Russia to the play and that will influence them. But
                I hope that this will not happen."</p>

              <p>Over the past few years, Pankov has been cited as one
                of Russia's most exciting and revolutionary directors
                as he champions a new theatre technique known as
                soundrama.</p>

              <p>Fusing live music, poetry, singing and the use of
                objects, in this instance oars, to create sound and
                music as the drama is played out, the play has almost a
                constant backdrop of noise, intended to elevate the
                audience's immersion in the piece.</p>

              <p>"What we were exploring, with the soundrama technique,
                was recreating the sounds of war," said Pankov. "Making
                almost a harmony using instruments and the human voice
                but also the sounds of screams, the screaming and
                crying of the wounded soldiers, trying to explore it as
                a way to make the experience seem more alive.</p>

              <p>"For me, each performer is a kind of musical
                instrument. It's not like a choir, more an ensemble of
                soloists."</p>

              <p>The epic nature of this production, he added, had
                brought this ceremonial style of theatre to a new
                level. "With soundrama, I would say what is most
                interesting for me is that we are living in the epoch
                where everything has been invented and developed and
                there are so many synthetic genres now.</p>

              <p>"Soundrama is a certain way of existence where we can
                juggle with those genres, we can easily pass from jazz
                to classical in our music and also flow between
                performing art genres."</p>

              <p>While all the music was composed for the play, and
                developed through improvisation at rehearsals, it drew
                on familiar songs – among them Amazing Grace and
                Scotland the Brave – to emphasise the universality of
                war and the suffering it inflicts.</p>

              <p>It was, said Pankov, his attempt to ensure members of
                his audience would see themselves reflected in the
                drama and music. "I hope that my play can talk to the
                audience like we are talking now," he said. "I believe
                that theatre can overcome these differences and it is a
                very powerful weapon. It is like the Goethe quotation:
                'If you want to build a state, begin with a theatre.'"</p>

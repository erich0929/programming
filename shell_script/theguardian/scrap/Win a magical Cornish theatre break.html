              <p>Waterfront boutique hotel the<strong> Old Quay
                House</strong> is offering one Guardian Extra member
                and a friend the chance to win a luxury two-night stay
                along with tickets to 'Dead Dog in a Suitcase (and
                other love songs)' produced by the award-winning
                Kneehigh Theatre.</p>

              <p>Perched on the water's edge in Fowey, Cornwall, the
                Old Quay House is famous for its 11 chic bedrooms, 'Q'
                restaurant and captivating coastal views. Originally
                built as a refuge for seamen, this whitewashed
                Victorian building is nestled among a labyrinth of
                galleries, restaurants, cafes and independent, quirky
                shops.</p>

              <p>The winners can explore the Lost Gardens of Heligan,
                known as Cornwall's 'sleeping beauty,' before immersing
                themselves in the award-winning Asylum experience. A
                two-course dinner will be served in the gardens, ahead
                of an evening full of theatrical twists and live music.</p>

              <p><strong>Our competition closes on 18 August. </strong></p>

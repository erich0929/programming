              <p>You can get the latest from theguardian.com using RSS
                feeds, a simple way to keep up with the news or with
                the subjects that matter most to you.</p>

              <p>You can use these feeds - of which there are hundreds
                of thousands - in a number of ways. Some web browsers
                and some mobile phones will allow you to monitor the
                feeds as a simple way of keeping up with the latest
                developments.</p>

              <p>There are also specialised web services and software
                applications which let you monitor our feeds alongside
                feeds from other websites. An examples of this is <a href="http://www.feeddemon.com/" title="">FeedDemon</a>
                (a piece of software).</p>

              <p>But you can also use these feeds to power widgets on a
                variety of other sites. As a simple example, you could
                add a box containing articles by your favourite
                Guardian columnist to your Facebook profile. Or you
                could add a feed of stories about Zimbabwe to your
                Google or Yahoo homepage.</p>

              <h2>How to find the feeds</h2>

              <p>The main page for every subject we cover, and many
                other pages, have a link to the relevant RSS feed at
                the top of the page next to an orange icon, like this:</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="Screenshot showing               location of webfeed link" height="200" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2008/10/16/1224174860147/Screenshot-showing-locati-001.jpg" width="460"/> </span>
              <p>There are feeds by subject matter (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/rss" title="">World news</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france/rss" title="">France</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics/rss" title="">Economics</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft/rss" title="">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/rss" title="">Tottenham Hotspur</a>), by journalist (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelwhite/rss" title="">Michael White</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charliebrooker/rss" title="">Charlie Brooker</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevebell/rss" title="">Steve Bell</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/pollytoynbee/rss" title="">Polly Toynbee</a>) and for a variety of other
                types of information (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/mostviewed/rss" title="">most popular stories</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/rss" title="">G2</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries/rss" title="">obituaries</a>. You can use the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/index/subjects/a" title="">a-z of subjects</a>, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/index/contributors/a" title="">a-z of contributors</a>, or the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian" title="">newspaper view</a> to find the ones that
                interest you most. When you get to the page you are
                interested in, look for the webfeed icon at top right.
                This links to the related feed.</p>

              <h2>How to locate the feeds by url</h2>

              <p>Or, you can find the feed for any index page simply by
                adding /rss to the url. So if you were looking at the
                Zimbabwe page:</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe" title="">http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe</a></p>

              <p>you could find the feed here:</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe/rss" title="">http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe/rss</a></p>

              <p>There are feeds for every contributor to the Guardian
                and Observer, on this pattern:</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/firstnamelastname/rss" title="">http://www.theguardian.com/profile/firstnamelastname/rss</a></p>

              <p>Some examples:</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker/rss" title="">http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker/rss</a></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevebell/rss" title="">http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevebell/rss</a></p>

              <p>Lastly, with a little ingenuity, it is possible to
                create your own feeds. For instance, you might want a
                feed of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/marinahyde+sport/sport" title="">Marina Hyde articles about sport</a>, or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/music+theguardian/g2" title="">music coverage in G2</a>. Here's a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2008/apr/11/lateeastereggs" title="">fuller explanation of the combination
                magic</a>.</p>

                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>This followed the only logical script for Tiger
                    Woods, for all that he may be unwilling to admit
                    it. Lee Westwood’s day at Valhalla was altogether
                    different, just at a time when the Englishman would
                    so benefit from time in the limelight. After 18 US
                    PGA Championship holes the gap between the pair was
                    nine strokes in Westwood’s favour.</p>

                  <p>Rory McIlroy? Suffice to say there is no reason to
                    remove his status as the clear favourite for this
                    tournament after his latest eventful day at work.
                    An ominous Friday weather forecast will play
                    further into the Northern Irishman’s hands.</p>

                  <p>Just as at last month’s Open, Woods declared in
                    advance of the final major of the year that he was
                    here to win. Of course he was; it would be unlike
                    Tiger to say anything else. The issue is that
                    public statements of intent are not backed up by
                    results any more; maybe Woods should set about the
                    lowering of expectations, owing to a clear
                    extenuating circumstance such as injury, despite
                    the blow such a stance may offer to the 14-time
                    major winner’s ego.</p>

                  <p>Woods chopped and scrambled his way around
                    Valhalla on day one of the season’s final major.
                    The end result was a 74, three-over par, at a venue
                    which has hardly been set up as ferocious.
                    Woods’s Fridayaim must be solely to make the cut,
                    which would constitute a decent achievement given
                    his ongoing back problems.</p>

                  <p>The 38-year-old recorded just a single birdie,
                    that coming as the result of a chip-in. Throughout
                    his round, Woods struggled to adequately judge the
                    pace of the greens.</p>

                  <p>He had only played nine pre-tournament holes –
                    and walked the other half –at a venue which has
                    changed beyond recognition since he triumphed in a
                    US PGA play-off 14 years ago. The dream-induced
                    case for him being successful in this event was not
                    borne out by reality.</p>

                  <p>Playing the back nine first, the first club slam
                    arrived after a pulled tee shot on the 14th. The
                    2nd bore witness to an audible “for fuck’s
                    sake, Tiger”; a dropped shot there moved him out
                    to three-over. He plodded along thereafter, until a
                    tee shot on the 7th, which proved further right
                    than Nick Griffin.</p>

                  <p>Woods at least had the good grace to miss his 6ft
                    putt for birdie at the par five after a free drop
                    from an area in a different postcode to the rest of
                    the hole.</p>

                  <p>Never mind Westwood, Woods trails Colin
                    Montgomerie by four and Tom Watson, the US Ryder
                    Cup captain, outscored him by two.</p>

                  <p>Others in the field made hay. It would seem
                    faintly ridiculous if Westwood, a veteran of eight
                    Ryder Cups, a positive team-room influence and
                    top-10 finisher at both the Masters and Players
                    Championship this year, is not part of the European
                    contingent at Gleneagles in September. Westwood’s
                    case, though, has not really been talked up by the
                    captain Paul McGinley so far.</p>

                  <p>A successful four days here would completely
                    change that dynamic. Westwood is off to a flying
                    start courtesy of a superb 65 which included a
                    double-bogey at the 1st, his 10th, and only 25
                    putts. The 41-year-old birdied his closing four
                    holes in a row to play the outward half of the
                    course in 32 shots.</p>

                  <p>This marked Westwood’s lowest career round on
                    day one of a major and the perfect follow-up to a
                    Sunday 63 at last weekend’s WGC-Bridgestone
                    Invitational.</p>

                  <p>“Last week was big for me, I felt like I turned
                    a corner,” Westwood said. “I was starting to
                    swing the club a lot better but that is no good
                    unless you start converting it into low rounds.
                    Then obviously I got things going on the final day.
                    I tried to keep it low-key in the practice rounds
                    here and carry my momentum through to the first
                    round, which I’ve managed to do by making nine
                    birdies.”</p>

                  <p>McIlroy reached the turn in three-under and had
                    bookmakers diving for cover before a wild second
                    shot to the 10th resulted in a double-bogey. The
                    Open champion then missed a short putt on 11 to
                    bounce himself back to even par.</p>

                  <p>He roared back brilliantly, with a stunning
                    exhibition of iron play which led to four birdies
                    in succession. His driving was not bad either, as
                    demonstrated by a 335-yard tee shot on the 17th. He
                    eventually signed for a 66.</p>

                  <p>Like McIlroy, Henrik Stenson profited from an
                    afternoon draw. The Swede’s 66 leaves him finely
                    poised. So, too, is Ian Poulter at three-under.</p>

                  <p>Elsewhere, the latest bad news for Watson was
                    delivered by Matt Kuchar and Jason Dufner. A back
                    injury forced Kuchar to withdraw before striking a
                    competitive ball. Dufner, the 2013 champion, lasted
                    10 holes before departing the scene with the
                    recurrence of a neck issue. At this rate Watson
                    might have to pick himself. Or even Woods.</p>

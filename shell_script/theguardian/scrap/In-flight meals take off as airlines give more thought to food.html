<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Many things are frowned on at 35,000ft. A flying
                chippie might well be considered one of them. But last
                week, British Airways threw caution to the wind and
                unveiled its "Flying Fish and Chip Supper", complete
                with vinegar and tartare sauce (though sadly no word on
                mushy peas).</p>

              <p>Remarkably, the result has not been the
                flabby-battered disappointment many surely expected,
                and – thanks to precision-timed preflight frying –
                has even earned the approval of Stuart Fusco,
                proprietor of the legendary <a href="http://quaysidewhitby.co.uk/" title="">Quayside
                fish and chip restaurant in Whitby</a>, North Yorkshire
                (Best in Britain at the National Fish and Chip awards).
                Praise indeed.</p>

              <p>It has long been a source of bafflement that, in an
                era where so many food-obsessed people now travel
                widely and eat adventurously, in-flight meals have
                remained so resolutely drab: the little cup of
                concentrated orange juice, the miserable iceberg
                lettuce, the ubiquitous tomato-based sauce – and my
                own personal bugbear: the omnipresent bowl of melon.</p>

              <p>Melon is, I suspect, a particular thorn in the side of
                the vegetarian flyer. There it is as our pudding, in
                lieu of the giant cake non-vegetarians are served; and
                then it pops up again, with breakfast. I fly quite
                often and, over the years, the quality of airline melon
                has vastly improved – it now retains some flavour,
                and its texture is no longer perplexingly rubbery.
                Occasionally, it even comes garnished with a grape. But
                still its reign confuses me. Isn't there another fruit
                alternative? What is it about melon that makes it so
                well-suited to in-flight catering?</p>

              <p>Relief may be coming, however, as it appears BA's
                daredevil fish-and-chip feat is part of a wider
                overhaul of onboard catering across the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry" title="More from the Guardian on Airline                 industry">airline industry</a>. "More and more airlines
                are giving food more thought," says Marc Warde,
                director of Premium Kitchen, part of airline caterers
                Alpha LSG Sky Chefs, though he is the first to admit
                the industry has been slow to join the culinary
                revolution. "I've been here seven months, and it seems
                quite behind the other areas of the catering industry."</p>

              <p>There are some important considerations for in-flight
                catering. For starters, as Warde points out, as soon as
                you take to the air, you are thrown into a world of
                variables. "Chefs do an amazing job on the ground, but
                then you're at the mercy of the cabin crew who cook the
                food in the air," he says. "And cabin crew aren't
                chefs."</p>

              <p>And then there are the physiological changes that
                occur when you fly. "Research has proved that taste
                buds change at altitude, making it more difficult to
                appreciate a good meal or wine," explains Jo Austin,
                editor of OnBoard Hospitality. "Reduced oxygen levels,
                pressurised cabins and low humidity dry out our mouths
                and numb the taste buds." This, Austin says, is why
                many airline caterers are introducing "ingredients that
                enhance flavours and excite the taste buds … spices,
                salts and stronger-flavoured wines. By the way," she
                adds, "did you know that at 35,000 feet you get drunk
                three times faster?"</p>

              <p>Alpha LSG caters for 75 airlines and has a culinary
                academy, charged with discovering new ways to make
                airline food more exciting. "The palate dries out
                naturally when you're in an aeroplane — but the food
                dries out too," Paul Mason, head of the academy,
                explains. As a result, he has to find food that is
                well-flavoured but also hydrating. "We're looking for
                food with the highest umami," he says. "Something that
                wakes your mouth up." A pot of chia seeds with mango
                and coconut or almond milk has recently been added to
                the breakfast menu, "because chia seeds are hydroponic
                – they release water while you eat them". Another
                development has been the kimchee slider. Meat travels
                well, Mason says, but: "Once you've rendered it, you
                have to char the outside to get any depth of flavour.
                Essentially, we're looking at ways to improve the taste
                of food without shoving lots of salt in it."</p>

              <p>Of course, not all aeroplane food is the same. "It
                depends where you sit," says Warde. "Most people sit at
                the back [in economy] because they don't want to pay
                for an upgrade." This has implications for the food
                served. The company recently came up with an idea for
                an economy meal upgrade, says Warde, "so passengers can
                spend a little extra to upgrade their food. They'll
                have a range of options and it will be a bit more
                foodie. Everything is artisan-produced."</p>

              <p>And will there still be melon? Warde laughs. "For most
                people, melon isn't offensive," he says. "But that's
                the point – melon is the globally inoffensive fruit.
                But there are ways of making it more exciting – how
                is it served? Is it cubes or balls? Can we make it
                alphonso mango?" And even I wouldn't frown on alphonso
                mango at 35,000 feet.</p>

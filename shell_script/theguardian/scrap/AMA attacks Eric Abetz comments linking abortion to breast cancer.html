                  <p>The Australian Medical Association has attacked
                    comments by Senator Eric Abetz linking abortion
                    with breast cancer.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Abetz, the leader of the government in the upper
                    house and the employment minister, appeared on the
                    Channel 10 program <a href="http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project?psearch=Google">The
                    Project </a>and was asked if he believed the
                    “factually incorrect” statement that abortion
                    leads to breast cancer.</p>

                  <p>“I think the studies, and I think they date back
                    from the 1950s, assert that there is a link between
                    abortion and breast cancer,” he said on Thursday
                    night.</p>

                  <p>The senator then said there were organisations,
                    other than the AMA, that had differing views.</p>

                  <p>The AMA’s president, Associate Professor Brian
                    Owler, said the senator had “cherry-picked” old
                    information skewed towards an anti-abortion
                    ideology. The comments were not based on current or
                    conventional medical evidence, he said.</p>

                  <p>“I just don’t understand why a senior member
                    of government would want to try to take on this
                    issue and put himself out in the media using
                    articles I’m told are from the 1950s as the basis
                    of his discussion,” Owler said.</p>

                  <p>“This is a serious issue and it should be
                    discussed on the basis of current medical evidence.
                    There is no evidence to say breast cancer and
                    abortion are linked.”</p>

                  <p>The professor said he respected freedom of speech
                    but Abetz’s comments came with significant
                    responsibility because of his senior government
                    role. “Let’s not use false evidence or try and
                    link abortion with other things such as breast
                    cancer,” he said. “I don’t think it’s fair
                    and it’s certainly not fair to people who may
                    have experienced breast cancer.”</p>

                  <p>Owler said AMA was also concerned at the
                    involvement of senior members of government,
                    including Abetz, with the World Congress of
                    Families event to be held this month in Melbourne.</p>

                  <p>On Friday Abetz issued a statement that
                    acknowledged the link was “not the accepted
                    medical view”. “Media reports that I have drawn
                    or believe there is a link between abortion and
                    breast cancer are incorrect,” he said. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    “In my interview last night on The Project I
                    studiously avoided doing so, and was cut off before
                    being able to acknowledge that Dr Angela
                    Lanfranchi’s views on this topic were not the
                    accepted medical view.”</p>

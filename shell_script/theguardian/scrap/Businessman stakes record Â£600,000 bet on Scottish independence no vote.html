              <p>A wealthy gambler has put £600,000 on a no vote in
                the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence" title="More from the Guardian on Scottish                 independence">Scottish independence</a> referendum, in
                what is thought to be the largest political bet in
                modern times.</p>

              <p>The bookies <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/williamhill" title="More from the Guardian on William Hill">William
                Hill</a> said a punter who first placed £400,000 on a
                no vote in June has now increased his stake to
                £600,000 in the wake of Alex Salmond's below par
                performance against no campaign leader Alistair Darling
                in Tuesday's televised referendum debate.</p>

              <p>The initial bet by the middle aged customer at a
                branch in Surrey, described as a businessman who will
                not have a vote in September's referendum, was close to
                the record political bet of A$750,000 (£419,000) <a href="http://www.sportsbet.com.au/blog/home/biggest-bet-in-australian-political-history-news" title="">placed on Australia's general election in
                September 2013</a>.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p></p>

              <p></p>

              <p>William Hill said it believed the increased wager had
                now made the bet a world record figure, but it was now
                offering a lower return on the extra £200,000 after
                cutting the odds on a no vote in September.</p>

              <p>The punter got odds of 1/4 on a no vote in June, but
                William Hill cut the odds since then to 1/6. He stands
                to make a profit of £133,333. Gamblers backing a yes
                vote are now being offered longer odds of 9/2, out from
                7/2, the company said.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Last week, it emerged that Ralph Topping, the outgoing
                chief executive of the bookmakers William Hill, who is
                credited with returning the firm to the FTSE100 had
                endorsed a yes vote.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Topping said in a statement released by
                pro-independence group Yes <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scotland">Scotland</a>
                that he believed there would be a currency union
                despite pledges from the chancellor, George Osborne,
                the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander,
                and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, that a sterling
                pact would be vetoed.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"It is not the location of a bank's brass plate in
                Scotland, but rather the concentration of economic
                assets in the rest of the UK that matters to British
                financial stability," Topping said. "The Treasury
                should stop playing politics and listen to market
                voices wanting a collaborative approach to the monetary
                system between an independent Scotland and the rest of
                the UK. In this respect, common sense economics was
                always going to trump politics."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for William Hill, said: "As
                the odds about a no vote had lengthened in the run-in
                to the recent TV debate in anticipation of a
                mind-changing performance by Alex Salmond, only for
                Alastair Darling to outshine him, it seems probable
                that the customer decided that now was the best moment
                to get the longest odds available, so he added 50% to
                what was already a record-busting bet."</p>

              <p>The Political Betting website reported that <a href="http://www1.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2014/08/07/the-indyref-yes-price-touches-rock-bottom-as-punters-give-their-verdict-on-salmonds-failure-to-win-tuesdays-debate/" title="">the odds on the yes campaign winning the
                referendum had lengthened further since Tuesday's
                debate</a>, taking the chances of the yes vote from
                between 20% to 24% down to 13.5% on Thursday.</p>

              <p>Prof David Bell, an economist at Stirling university
                and an expert in the economics of Scottish
                independence, said last month that his analysis of the
                pattern of political betting on the referendum <a href="http://www.stir.ac.uk/news/news-archive/2014/07/recent-betting-trends-suggest-chance-of-a-no-outcome-has-increased/name-79628-en.html" title="">put the odds of a no vote in September at
                79%</a>.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Bell said the odds against a yes vote had lengthened
                partly because of the £400,000 bet taken by William
                Hill in June. While there was a large number of bets on
                yes winning, the sums involved were much smaller than
                the bets placed on no winning.</p>

              <p>"Some of the change in odds will also be a response to
                punters who are willing to bet heavily on a no outcome,
                including the individual reported widely in the media
                recently for placing a bet of £400,000 on Scotland
                staying part of the UK," he said last month.</p>

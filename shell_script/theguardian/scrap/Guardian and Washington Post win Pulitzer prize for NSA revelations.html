                  <p>The Guardian and the Washington Post have been
                    awarded the highest accolade in US journalism,
                    winning the Pulitzer prize for public service for
                    their <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">groundbreaking
                    articles on the National Security Agency’s
                    surveillance activities</a> based on the leaks of
                    Edward Snowden.</p>

                  <p>The award, announced in New York on Monday, comes
                    10 months after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">the
                    Guardian published the first report based on the
                    leaks from Snowden</a>, revealing the agency’s
                    bulk collection of US citizens’ phone records.</p>

                  <p>In the series of articles that ensued, teams of
                    journalists at the Guardian and the Washington Post
                    published the most substantial disclosures of US
                    government secrets since the Pentagon Papers on the
                    Vietnam war in 1971.</p>

                  <p>The Pulitzer committee <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2014-Public-Service">praised
                    the Guardian</a> for its "revelation of widespread
                    secret surveillance by the National Security
                    Agency, helping through aggressive reporting to
                    spark a debate about the relationship between the
                    government and the public over issues of security
                    and privacy".</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/14/edward-snowden-pulitzer-statement-prize-guardian-washington-post">Snowden,
                    in a statement, said</a>: "Today's decision is a
                    vindication for everyone who believes that the
                    public has a role in government. We owe it to the
                    efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues
                    who kept working in the face of extraordinary
                    intimidation, including the forced destruction of
                    journalistic materials, the inappropriate use of
                    terrorism laws, and so many other means of pressure
                    to get them to stop what the world now recognises
                    was work of vital public importance."</p>

                  <p>He said that his actions in leaking the documents
                    that formed the basis of the reporting "would have
                    been meaningless without the dedication, passion,
                    and skill of these newspapers".</p>

                  <p>The Pulitzers have been bestowed since 1917, at
                    the bequest of the legendary newspaper publisher
                    Joseph Pulitzer who established the honour in his
                    will as a means of encouraging publicly-spirited
                    journalism. Awards were given in 22 categories this
                    year: the Boston Globe received the Pulitzer for
                    breaking for "exhaustive and empathetic" coverage
                    of the Boston marathon bombing. Journalists in the
                    Globe newsroom observed a period of silence on
                    Monday in memory of the victims, a day before the
                    one-year anniversary of the attack.</p>

                  <p>At the Guardian, the NSA reporting was led by
                    Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill and film-maker
                    Laura Poitras, and at the Washington Post by Barton
                    Gellman, who also co-operated with Poitras. All
                    four journalists were honoured with a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/11/journalists-nsa-guardian-polk-award-snowden">George

                  <p>The NSA revelations have reverberated around the
                    world and sparked a debate in the US over the
                    balance between national security and personal
                    privacy. On the back of the disclosures, President
                    Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/17/remarks-president-review-signals-intelligence">ordered
                    a White House review into data surveillance</a>, a
                    number of congressional reform bills have been
                    introduced, and protections have begun to be put in
                    place to safeguard privacy for foreign leaders and
                    to increase scrutiny over the NSA’s mass data
                    collection.</p>

                  <p>"We are truly honoured that our journalism has
                    been recognised with the Pulitzer prize," said Alan
                    Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian.
                    "This was a complex story, written, edited and
                    produced by a team of wonderful journalists. We are
                    particularly grateful for our colleagues across the
                    world who supported the Guardian in circumstances
                    which threatened to stifle our reporting. And we
                    share this honour, not only with our colleagues at
                    the Washington Post, but also with Edward Snowden,
                    who risked so much in the cause of the public
                    service which has today been acknowledged by the
                    award of this prestigious prize."</p>

                  <p>Janine Gibson, the editor-in-chief of Guardian US,
                    said: "We're extremely proud and gratified to have
                    been honoured by the Pulitzer board. It's been an
                    intense, exhaustive and sometimes chilling year
                    working on this story, and we're grateful for the
                    acknowledgement by our peers that the revelations
                    made by Edward Snowden and the work by the
                    journalists involved represent a high achievement
                    in public service."</p>

                  <p>Among the disclosures were:<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>• the NSA’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">mass
                    dragnet of phone records of millions of
                    Americans</a>.</p>

                  <p>• the program <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">codenamed
                    Prism </a>used by the NSA and its UK counterpart
                    GCHQ to gain back-door entry into the data of nine
                    giant internet companies including Google and
                    Facebook.</p>

                  <p>• the <a href="about:blank">cracking of internet
                    encryption</a> by the NSA and GCHQ that undermined
                    personal security for web users.</p>

                  <p>• NSA s<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls">urveillance
                    of phone calls made by 35 world leaders</a>.</p>

                  <p>The coverage of the Snowden leaks presented a
                    particularly thorny issue for the 19-strong panel
                    of journalists, academics and writers who recommend
                    the winners. The stream of disclosures invoked
                    strong and polarised reactions in the US and around
                    the world.</p>

                  <p>In January, Obama said that the debate on the
                    acceptable limits of government surveillance
                    prompted by the articles “will make us
                    stronger”. But other prominent US politicians
                    such as Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the
                    House intelligence committee, have suggested
                    journalism based on Snowden’s leaks was
                    tantamount to dealing in stolen property.</p>

                  <p>Snowden has been charged with three offences in
                    the US. He is the eighth person to be charged with
                    breaking the 1917 Espionage Act by the Obama
                    administration – more than all the prosecutions
                    brought under previous presidents combined.</p>

                  <p>The Guardian's US operation, headquartered in New
                    York, was incorporated as an American company in
                    2011 and recognised last year by the Pulitzer board
                    as a US news outlet eligible to be considered for
                    its prizes.</p>

                  <p>Last month Rusbridger was given a special <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">award
                    at </a>the European press awards; earlier this
                    month the Guardian was named newspaper of the year
                    in the UK; and there it has been awarded other
                    prizes for online and investigative journalism in
                    Germany, Spain and the US.</p>

                  <p>The Snowden stories were edited from New York by
                    Gibson, and Guardian US deputy editor Stuart
                    Millar. The UK end of the reporting was led by
                    deputy editor Paul Johnson and investigations
                    editor Nick Hopkins.</p>

                  <p>Others on the team of journalists included Spencer
                    Ackerman, James Ball, David Blishen, Gabriel Dance,
                    Julian Borger, Nick Davies, David Leigh and Dominic
                    Rushe. In Australia the editor was Katharine Viner
                    and the reporter Lenore Taylor.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Among the other Pulitzers, Will Hobson and Michael
                    LaForgia of the Tampa Bay Times won for local
                    reporting for their investigation into the housing
                    blight of the city’s homeless population; and the
                    New York Times’s Tyler Hicks and Josh Haner took
                    the two photography prizes.</p>

                  <p>The Pulitzer for fiction writing went to Donna
                    Tartt for The Goldfinch, while Annie Baker won the
                    prize for drama for her play set in a cinema, The
                    Flick. Become Ocean, a piece commissioned by the
                    Seattle Symphony by John Luther Adams, won the
                    Pulitzer for music.</p>

                  <p> All the awards are administered by Columbia
                    University. <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/2014">The full

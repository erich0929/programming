              <p>The judge in the five-month murder trial of South
                African Paralympic and Olympic athlete <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/oscar-pistorius" title="More from the Guardian on Oscar Pistorius">Oscar
                Pistorius</a> said on Friday she would deliver her
                verdict on 11 September.</p>

              <p>Double-amputee Pistorius, 27, once a national icon, is
                accused of murdering Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate
                and model, at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day
                last year.</p>

              <p>He faces 25 years in jail if convicted, but has
                pleaded not guilty, saying he shot Steenkamp in a
                tragic accident, mistaking her for an intruder.</p>

              <p>After two days in which defence and prosecution
                counsels delivered their closing arguments, Thokozile
                Masipa said: "We shall be back here on the 11th of
                September at 9:30 for the judgment."</p>

              <p>During a trial that has heard testimony from nearly 40
                witnesses, the athlete – celebrated for his journey
                from disabled child to Olympic athlete – often cut a
                wretched figure.</p>

              <p>Amid gruesome evidence about Steenkamp's gunshot
                wounds to the head, hip and hand Pistorius vomited in
                the dock and later frequently broke down in tears.</p>

              <p>Proceedings ended on Friday with defence lawyer Barry
                Roux insisting the "cold facts" did not prove his
                client's guilt and that the state's case was
                "circumstantial".</p>

              <p>Roux sought to show there was enough doubt about the
                prosecution to make a murder conviction impossible. He
                said the evidence suggested the paralympian should
                never have faced a murder trial, but rather the lesser
                charge of culpable homicide.</p>

              to video: Oscar Pistorius was 'vulnerable', defence
              argues</a> </span>
              <p>The defence has sought to explain Pistorius's actions
                as those of a "highly-vulnerable individual" obsessed
                with safety – a result of a difficult childhood and
                his disability – in a country with a high crime rate.</p>

              <p>The trial was delayed for a month as Pistorius
                underwent psychiatric evaluation. An ensuing report
                said he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder,
                but not any mental illness that could prevent him being
                held criminally responsible for his actions.</p>

              <p>Roux said on Friday that the "slow burn" caused by
                Pistorius's anxiety is comparable to that of an abused
                woman who finally attacks her husband.. The judge
                asked: "How does it apply to the accused in this
                case?".</p>

              <p>Roux replied: "That constant reminder, I do not have
                legs, I cannot run away, I am not the same, that's with
                him, he can't pretend, he can't pretend that it's
                fine."</p>

              <p>On Thursday Pistorius was branded a deceitful witness
                by prosecutor Gerrie Nel in his final arguments. He
                said Pistorius's efforts to concoct an alibi had led to
                a "snowball effect" of lies requiring more lies to back
                them up.</p>

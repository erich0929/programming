              <p>The propaganda battle in a modern war begins with
                its&nbsp;name. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a>'s
                attack on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a> this
                summer was given an official Hebrew name meaning
                "resolute cliff", so as to assure its victims of the
                futility of resistance. Only a fool would try to fight
                a cliff, even an irresolute one. The name in English
                was "Operation Protective Edge". This, <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/355946--from-shield-to-edge-how-israel-names-its-military-ops" title="">an Israeli military spokesman explained, was
                chosen to "give a&nbsp;more 'defensive'
                connotation"</a>. (The&nbsp;bombing was supposedly
                "protective", though not of those bombed.) Just so, the
                Israel Defence Forces are quite often seen to be on the
                attack, and every civilised country has
                a&nbsp;department or ministry of "defence"
                in&nbsp;which aggressive campaigns may be&nbsp;plotted.</p>

              <p>The people fighting on either side of&nbsp;this
                "clash" or "conflict" (but rarely "war") were named in
                ways carefully emphasising a gulf in respectability:
                Israeli "soldiers" but Hamas "militants". To Israel,
                naturally, the Hamas fighters were "terrorists". They
                had built <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/21/how-hamas-uses-its-tunnels-to-kill-and-capture-israeli-soldiers" title="">"terror tunnels"</a> passing into Israel,
                through which more threatening things than funfair
                ghost trains could indeed roll. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/21/how-hamas-uses-its-tunnels-to-kill-and-capture-israeli-soldiers" title="">Binyamin Netanyahu said, moreover, that Hamas
                had turned UN&nbsp;facilities into "terrorist
                hotspots"</a>. A&nbsp;terrorist hotspot is rather like
                a&nbsp;Wi-Fi&nbsp;hotspot: when you are within range,
                you can be sure of getting a&nbsp;terrorist.
                Of&nbsp;course, if your means of&nbsp;getting him is a
                large bomb, you will&nbsp;certainly get a&nbsp;bunch of
                other people too. This is something to express mild
                regret about afterwards, but not something to be
                avoided, even&nbsp;though it is a certain and
                foreseeable consequence.</p>

              <p>That consequence was said rather to&nbsp;be the fault
                of Hamas, for using the people of Gaza as "human
                shields". Evidently no one thinks that a human body of
                flesh and bone can actually stop bullets or explosives.
                So a&nbsp;"human shield" is only a shield if it deters
                the attacker. Israel was not deterred. Thus&nbsp;it
                didn't really consider those being killed by its bombs
                "shields" at&nbsp;all. According to the OED, the term
                "human shield" in fact means using persons "held
                against their will near a&nbsp;potential military
                target". Were Gazans staying in their houses or
                going&nbsp;to school against their will? In&nbsp;any
                case, as it turned out, to Israel's strategists the
                whole of Gaza was a&nbsp;"potential military target".
                It&nbsp;followed, perhaps, that the entire population
                could thus be considered human shields, shortly before
                they were bombed anyway.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/world/middleeast/in-a-clash-between-israel-and-gaza-both-sides-use-social-media-to-fire-epithets-and-hide-behind-euphemisms.html" title="">Hamas told its supporters, when referring to
                those killed by Israeli actions, always to use the
                phrase "an&nbsp;innocent citizen"</a>, though some
                of&nbsp;those killed had actually been fighting or
                launching rockets at Israeli towns. But&nbsp;the wider
                metaphysical problem of&nbsp;this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/language" title="More from the Guardian on Language">language</a>
                is: who among us is innocent? Of everything? At least
                most could agree that children are the
                least&nbsp;deserving of death. And&nbsp;so&nbsp;news
                reports came to emphasise the number&nbsp;of children
                killed in attacks. It&nbsp;was hard, after all, to
                figure out who among the grownups were "civilians" (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/world/middleeast/in-a-clash-between-israel-and-gaza-both-sides-use-social-media-to-fire-epithets-and-hide-behind-euphemisms.html" title="">or at least "uninvolved", as&nbsp;Israel
                prefers to&nbsp;say</a>). In this way
                the&nbsp;blameless adult&nbsp;dead were, perhaps,
                somewhat demoted in the world's calculus of sympathy.</p>

              <p>The Gazan war has also expanded our taxonomy of
                ceasefires. Back in&nbsp;2006 during Israel's attack on
                Lebanon, <a href="http://unspeak.net/sustainable/" title="">Condoleezza Rice had called&nbsp;subtly
                for&nbsp;a "sustainable ceasefire"</a>, as a way of
                rejecting demands for&nbsp;an actual ceasefire now. The
                preferred language from the UN and US&nbsp;in 2014 was
                "durable ceasefire". But&nbsp;the best new&nbsp;kind of
                ceasefire was&nbsp;that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28635031" title="">announced unilaterally by&nbsp;Israel on
                4&nbsp;August</a>: a&nbsp;"partial ceasefire". As <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28635031" title="">the&nbsp;New York Times reported, this
                ceasefire "was to&nbsp;take place only in areas where
                Israel was not&nbsp;engaged in&nbsp;military
                activity"</a>. In&nbsp;other words: during this
                ceasefire we will not cease firing in places
                where&nbsp;we&nbsp;are already firing, but
                only&nbsp;where we weren't firing&nbsp;to
                begin&nbsp;with.</p>

              <p>All this slaughter was routinely called a "tragedy".
                Hamas rocket attacks on Israel were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28635031" title="">"inexcusable", Barack Obama said</a>, while
                "the death and injury of Palestinian civilians"
                was&nbsp;a "tragedy". As usual, the term "tragedy"
                worked as a way to&nbsp;avoid apportioning blame. A
                tragedy is a&nbsp;literary work in which the hero
                comes&nbsp;to a sticky end through a&nbsp;combination
                of character flaw and&nbsp;circumstance. Alternatively,
                it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;disco lament for the
                disappearance of&nbsp;loving feelings. But when
                children and their parents die in a&nbsp;bombing,
                it&nbsp;is&nbsp;because someone has&nbsp;bombed them.</p>

              <p>There were complaints about specific events within the
                "tragedy", however, particularly the blowing-up of a UN
                school in Rafah. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28635031" title="">The Americans said they were appalled by this
                "disgraceful shelling"</a>. Observers evinced surprise
                and outrage&nbsp;that horrible things could happen when
                people lob explosives at&nbsp;one another. In the
                rhetorical background there lurked still a utopian
                vision of some possible war with no disgraceful bits
                in&nbsp;it. There has never, of course, been any such
                thing.</p>

                  <p>A former Sun reporter charged with criminal
                    offences in relation to a stolen phone has told how
                    his career was destroyed after he was arrested.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He was sacked by the Daily Mail in the US and
                    could not even return to collect his personal
                    belongings after his visa was “voided”.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Ben Ashford told jurors how his dream of working
                    in the US was shattered by his arrest in 2012 in
                    relation to an incident that happened while he was
                    working at the Sun three years earlier.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He been in the US working for a News Corporation
                    outlet and after being made redundant was in the
                    process of moving to a new job at the Mail in
                    America when he was arrested on a brief trip back
                    home.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“I was in the process of applying for a new job
                    and the visa was attached to the job. After my
                    arrest I was told not to come back into the Daily
                    Mail office,” Ashford told jurors at the Old
                    Bailey where he is standing trial.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“I was met by two senior members of staff. I was
                    given a letter saying I was sacked.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Describing his career in America he said: “It
                    was exactly what I had wanted to do, it was
                    fantastic. I really really enjoyed it.” He added:
                    “It was a dream.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Ashford has been charged with two criminal
                    offences in relation to a stolen mobile phone he
                    examined after it was handed into the Sun in 2009
                    while he was working for the paper in Manchester.
                    He denies the charges.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The 35-year-old, who is now working for a news
                    agency in Plymouth, is the first person on trial in
                    relation to Operation Tuleta, Scotland Yard’s
                    investigation into computer hacking.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He has been charged with possession of criminal
                    property and accessing messages on the phone
                    without authorisation of its owner, a female PR
                    executive.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>In the second day of his trial, Ashford told
                    jurors how he had dreamed of being a journalist
                    when he studied English at Manchester University.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He got his first break on the Croydon Advertiser
                    after completing a postgraduate diploma in
                    journalism and got experience on a typical local
                    reporter’s beat, which included stories on
                    everything from cake sales to murders.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>After two years on a crime beat at a London news
                    agency, he started getting shifts at the Sun and
                    eventually landed a full time role in Manchester.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He said he was “gutted” by the decision to
                    send him up north as all his police contacts and
                    contacts with others including lobby groups and
                    victims’ families were in London.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He eventually left to take up a new job with News
                    Corp, the ultimate owner of the Sun, but was made
                    redundant in the summer of 2009, the year he got
                    offered the job on the Mail in New York.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He told jurors that because he lost his job in the
                    US, his visa application was “voided” and after
                    consulting two emigration lawyers was told that he
                    could not return to America.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>“I wasn’t able to even go back to collect my
                    belongings,” Ashford said.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The jury has heard how three years earlier in
                    2009, Ashford was despatched to meet a tipster who
                    had contacted the Sun offices in London claiming to
                    have evidence of a celebrity cheating on his
                    long-term girlfriend.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He met the tipster who handed him a phone which
                    three days later he handed back to the owner, a PR
                    executive.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The jury heard that before handing it back,
                    Ashford had examined the contents of the phone and
                    produced an 18 page dossier for his London bosses
                    containing details of “saucy messages” and
                    “X-rated photos” exchanged between the owner
                    and a TV personality who cannot be named.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>He told jurors he found it “difficult” to
                    recall events of three years ago because he was so
                    busy at the time, he hadn’t stopped to consider
                    what he was doing.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Asked by his counsel, Orlando Pownall, if had
                    spent much time considering events between 11
                    November 2009 when he gave a statement to the
                    police about the phone and 2012 when he was
                    arrested, he replied: “Absolutely none
                    whatsoever.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Asked how much time he had spent thinking about
                    these events since his arrest, he replied:
                    “Practically every waking moment I’ve thought
                    about it.”</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The trial continues.</p>

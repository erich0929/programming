                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>A former reporter on the Sun on trial over a
                    stolen mobile phone was told by a colleague on the
                    paper that it was unlikely the police would
                    prosecute, a jury has heard.</p>

                  <p>The reporter discovered more than 1,000 messages,
                    some of “a sexually explicit type”, between a
                    TV personality and a PR agent, after a tipster
                    contacted the paper’s newsdesk over a phone. She
                    claimed she had found the phone on the floor
                    outside a nightclub in Manchester.</p>

                  <p>The tipster was a 20-year-old student and had
                    emailed the Sun’s Talkback address saying she had
                    a “top story” with evidence that a TV
                    personality was “cheating on his long-term
                    girlfriend”.</p>

                  <p>“I’m a completely unrelated third party who
                    happened to stumble upon this incriminating piece
                    of evidence. I would be interested in selling this
                    story,” wrote Sameena Rashid.</p>

                  <p>Ben Ashford was sent to meet Rashid in October
                    2009 and took possession of the phone which
                    belonged to the PR agent.</p>

                  <p>The Manchester-based reporter spent hours trawling
                    through the phone and drew up an 18-page report
                    about the picture and text messages between its
                    owner, who cannot be named for legal reasons and
                    two TV stars who cannot be named either.</p>

                  <p>One Sun editor, James Clothier, labelled the star
                    a “dirty cheating dawg” but the paper decided
                    not to run any story, the court heard.</p>

                  <p>The reporter is on trial at the Old Bailey accused
                    of handling the stolen phone and accessing messages
                    on the PR agent’s iPhone without her authority.
                    He is the first to be on trial in relation to
                    Operation Tuleta, Scotland Yard’s investigation
                    into computer hacking.</p>

                  <p>Ashford denies possession of criminal property and
                    securing unauthorised access to computer material.</p>

                  <p>The jury were told Ashford had discovered the
                    contents included “x-rated snaps of herself”
                    and “saucy messages” from one of the TV
                    personalities.</p>

                  <p>They also heard Ashford had been told by Rashid
                    that a friend of hers had said he had found the
                    iPhone on the ground while having a cigarette
                    outside the Circle Club in Manchester.</p>

                  <p>Days later the PR posted a message on Twitter,
                    saying “some Mo” had stolen her handbag,
                    leading to a further exchange of emails among
                    senior Sun journalists and Ashford about the phone.</p>

                  <p>The Sun assistant news editor, Steve Kennedy,
                    emailed Ashford and a senior Sun executive who
                    cannot be named: “Are the cops really going to
                    prosecute everyone who collects a stolen item and
                    returns it in good faith? Are they fuck?”</p>

                  <p>Jurors heard that Ashford returned the phone to
                    the PR through a friend on 16 October and included
                    his contact details in the package.</p>

                  <p>Subsequently, the PR reported her phone had been
                    stolen and some weeks later, Ashford was
                    interviewed by police. In an email to his bosses,
                    he said he had told police that he had not in
                    effect stolen any content – “ie downloaded”
                    from the phone, but that this was a “grey area”
                    and the police “just wanted information on the
                    thief”.</p>

                  <p>PC David Southern, the interviewing officer,
                    confirmed to jurors he was treated as a witness in
                    relation to the theft of a stolen phone but not
                    treated as a suspect.</p>

                  <p>Three years later, Ashford was charged with two
                    criminal offences after News International’s
                    management and standards committee handed Scotland
                    Yard detectives internal emails about the phone
                    including his 18-page summary of its contents.</p>

                  <p>Under cross examination, Southern confirmed the
                    reporter told him he had looked at the contents of
                    the phone.</p>

                  <p>Under re-examination by the prosecution, Southern
                    said Ashford had not given “any indication”
                    that he had “looked at any photos” or that he
                    had “looked at any messages”.</p>

                  <p>Among the emails shown to the jury was the initial
                    approach from Rashid who contacted the Sun’s
                    “talkback” email to say she had a “top
                    story”.</p>

                  <p>The email read: “Hi there, I have proof that [B]
                    has been cheating with his long term girlfriend.
                    I’m a completely unrelated third party who
                    happened to stumble upon this incriminating piece
                    of evidence. I would be interested in selling this
                    story.”</p>

                  <p>Wright told the jury a Sun journalist, Will
                    Barker, responded to the email “within a
                    minute” telling her: “We would be very
                    interested.” After Ashford had obtained the phone
                    and looked at the contents, Barker told him: “As
                    it turns out, the (star A) stuff is a much better
                    story. Only have one hope with this, track down the
                    girl [the owner] and hope she bites.”</p>

                  <p>Rashid accepted a caution for the “theft by
                    finding” of the phone, the jury was told</p>

                  <p>Reports that Islamic militants have<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat">
                    trapped up to 40,000</a> members of Iraq’s
                    minority communities have spurred the US into
                    considering a military-led humanitarian action.</p>

                  <p>Most of the trapped people are members of the
                    Yazidi religion, one of Iraq’s oldest minorities.
                    They were forced to flee to Mount Sinjar in the
                    Iraqi north-west region, or face slaughter by an
                    encircling group of Islamic State (Isis) jihadists.
                    The UN has said that roughly 40,000 people – many
                    women and children – have taken refuge in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat">nine
                    locations</a> on the mountain, “a craggy,
                    mile-high ridge identified in local legend as the<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat">
                    final resting place of Noah’s ark</a>”.</p>

                  <p>Gruesome images of brutally slain people have
                    emerged in the past week, as local officials say
                    that at least 500 Yazidis, including 40 children,
                    have been killed, and many more have been
                    threatened with death. Roughly 130,000 residents of
                    the Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar have fled to Dohuk,
                    in Iraqi Kurdistan to the north, or to Irbil.</p>

                  <p>Reports of violence, repression and murder by Isis
                    and other extremist groups have become increasingly
                    prevalent in Iraq. Christians have also been
                    targeted for their faith. The country’s largest
                    Christian city was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/isis-offensive-iraq-christian-exodus">all
                    but abandoned</a> on Thursday, as Isis advanced
                    through minority communities in the
                    north-west.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>On Thursday, the UNSC condemned the Isis attacks
                    on the Yazidi community, saying those responsible
                    could face trial for crimes against humanity.</p>

                  <h2>Who are the Yazidis?</h2>

                  <p>Estimates put the global number of Yazidis at
                    around 700,000 people, with the vast majority of
                    them concentrated in northern Iraq, in and around
                    Sinjar.</p>

                    A historically misunderstood group, the Yazidis are
                    predominantly ethnically Kurdish, and have kept
                    alive their syncretic religion for centuries,
                    despite many years of oppression and threatened
                    extermination.</p>

                  <p>The ancient religion is rumoured to have been
                    founded by an 11th century Ummayyad sheikh, and is
                    derived from Zoroastrianism (an ancient Persian
                    faith founded by a philosopher), Christianity and
                    Islam. The religion has taken elements from each,
                    ranging from baptism (Christianity) to circumcision
                    (Islam) to reverence of fire as a manifestation
                    from God (derived from Zoroastrianism) and yet
                    remains distinctly non-Abrahamic. This derivative
                    quality has often led the Yazidis to be referred to
                    as a sect.</p>

                  <p>At the core of the Yazidis’ marginalization is
                    their worship of a fallen angel, Melek Tawwus, or
                    Peacock Angel, one of the seven angels that take
                    primacy in their beliefs. Unlike the fall from
                    grace of Satan, in the Judeo-Christian tradition,
                    Melek Tawwus was forgiven and returned to heaven by
                    God. The importance of Melek Tawwus to the Yazidis
                    has given them an undeserved reputation for being
                    devil-worshippers – a notoriety that, in the
                    climate of extremism gripping Iraq, has turned
                    life-threatening.</p>

                  <p>Under Ottoman rule in the 18th and 19th centuries
                    alone, the Yazidis were subject to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/03/world/bashiqa-journal-a-sect-shuns-lettuce-and-gives-the-devil-his-due.html">
                    72 genocidal massacres</a>. More recently in 2007,
                    hundreds of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6946028.stm">Yazidis
                    were killed</a> as a spate of car bombs ripped
                    through their stronghold in northern Iraq. With
                    numbers of dead as close to 800, according to the
                    Iraqi Red Crescent, this was one of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/world/middleeast/22iraq-top.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=login">single
                    deadliest events</a> to take place during the
                    American-led invasion.</p>

                  <p>The Yazidis had been denounced as infidels by
                    Al-Qaida in Iraq, a predecessor of Isis, which
                    sanctioned their indiscriminate killing.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi MP in Iraq, broke down in
                    tears on Wednesday, as she called on the parliament
                    and the international community to “Save us! Save
                    us!” from Isis.</p>

                  <p>Researcher Cale Salih (<a href="https://twitter.com/callysally">@callysally</a>)
                    interviewed the Yazidis’ spiritual leader Baba
                    Sheikh <a href="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/islamic-extremists-pose-new-risks-for-religious-minorities-in-iraq/">for
                    the New York Times last month</a>. She wrote:</p>

                  <blockquote class="quoted">
                    <p>The rise of Islamic fundamentalism more broadly
                      has pushed thousands of Yazidis to seek asylum in
                      Europe. According to some estimates, 70,000
                      people, or about 15% of the Yazidi population in
                      Iraq, fled the country. For a religion that does
                      not accept converts and strongly discourages
                      exogamy, the assimilation of Yazidi youth in
                      Europe threatens the faith’s continued
                      existence. “People have gone out of fear of
                      attacks or fear of racism. This makes it hard to
                      protect the faith,” said Baba Sheikh. [...]

                    </p>

                    <p>For the past several years, Baba Sheikh, the
                      Yazidis’ spiritual leader, tells me he has
                      canceled the official yearly religious ceremony
                      at Lalesh temple, the holy site of the Yazidis,
                      out of fear of attacks.</p>

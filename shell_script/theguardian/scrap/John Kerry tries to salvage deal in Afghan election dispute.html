              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry" title="More from the Guardian on John Kerry">John
                Kerry</a> met rival candidates in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan" title="More from the Guardian on                 Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>'s contested presidential
                election on Friday after a deal between the two
                unravelled.</p>

              <p>The US secretary of state arrived in Kabul on Thursday
                in an attempt to salvage the faltering political and
                technical agreements that he brokered between <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/abdullah-abdullah" title="More from the Guardian on Abdullah                 Abdullah">Abdullah Abdullah</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ashraf-ghani" title="More from the Guardian on Ashraf Ghani">Ashraf
                Ghani</a> last month.</p>

              <p>The deal, agreed after a marathon negotiating session,
                was intended to produce a winner in Afghanistan's
                election but has fallen apart in the four weeks since
                it was reached, with fistfights breaking out in the
                auditing centre and the process being halted numerous
                times.</p>

              <p>Abdullah wants clarity on the political agreement and
                Ghani does not want to commit to it until the vote
                audit, which he hopes will declare him the winner, is
                complete.</p>

              <p>Ghani, a former World Bank technocrat, emerged from
                the runoff on 14&nbsp;June in the lead but Abdullah, a
                former mujahideen doctor, claimed that 2m of the votes
                cast for his rival were fake.</p>

              <p>The seven-point political agreement outlines the steps
                to be taken after the audit. According to negotiators
                who helped broker the deal, the agreement states that a
                president will take office immediately and hold a
                <em>loya jirga</em>, or meeting of elders, to create a
                new prime minister position within the first two years.</p>

              <p>The president will also create the position of
                opposition leader, to be appointed by the runner-up,
                and both the winner and the loser will select certain
                posts in national security and economic institutions.</p>

              <p>The president alone will appoint ministers, the chief
                justice and other key provincial positions. With an eye
                on future elections, the agreement also calls on the
                two candidates to begin work on electoral reform to
                address some of the shortcomings of this year's ballot.</p>

              <p>Concerns are mounting that the progress of the audit
                has been dramatically slower than anticipated. Western
                officials and the UN hope that the audit will be
                complete before a Nato summit in September, but the
                first week of the auditing proved that this was
                unlikely.</p>

              <p>Fabrizio Foschini, of the Afghanistan Analysts
                Network, said Kerry's visit was a sign of improving
                conditions. "It shows a high level of commitment on the
                part of the international community that they want the
                audit plus political process to end the way that it was
                envisioned," he said. "It remains to be seen whether
                this risks becoming a pattern, where every time you
                have a crisis, it cannot be solved without external
                input."</p>

              <p>In a sprawling metropolis synonymous with crime,
                political violence and creeping Talibanisation, few
                people are interested in wandering the streets to
                explore hidden heritage.</p>

              <p>Muggings and carjackings are perils of daily life,
                while many of the architectural gems of the city of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/karachi" title="More from the Guardian on Karachi">Karachi</a>
                in southern <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan" title="More from the Guardian on Pakistan">Pakistan</a>
                are hidden in the roughest parts of town, far away from
                the suburban sprawl where most well-heeled city
                dwellers live.</p>

              <p>However, one enthusiastic amateur is encouraging his
                fellow Karachiites to ignore the dangers and explore a
                city full of once handsome 19th-century buildings, many
                in a state of advanced decay. "Karachiites are
                completely unaware of the heritage they have," said
                Farooq Soomro, a young office worker who spends his
                spare time leading intrepid explorers on tours of the
                metropolis. "When visitors used to ask me what to
                visit, I realised I didn't know my own city."</p>

              <p>For the past few years he has helped to spark local
                interest in the architectural curiosities dotted around
                town by posting photos and stories on his <a href="http://thekarachiwalla.com/" title="">Karachi
                Walla</a> website. Articles on meeting houses built for
                the <a href="http://thekarachiwalla.com/2011/10/20/city-landmarks-goan-association-hall/" title="">city's community of Goan Christians</a>, <a href="http://thekarachiwalla.com/2011/04/05/karachi-landmarks-the-freemasons-lodge/" title="">masonic lodges </a>and <a href="http://thekarachiwalla.com/2014/03/09/city-landmarks-gurdwara-ratan-talao/" title="">Sikh gurdwaras</a> highlight the faded
                grandeur of the city's colonial period and the cultural
                diversity of what was once one of the world's great
                ports.</p>

              <p>But many of the attractions are hidden away in a city
                that grew rapidly from a fishing village in the early
                1800s into today's metropolis of 23 million people.
                Soomro discovered that even people who are enthusiastic
                sightseers on their travels abroad were almost ignorant
                of what was available on their doorstep.</p>

              <p>"It's partly because of the infamous social divide
                between Clifton and Defence people and the rest of
                Karachi," he says, referring to the city's upmarket
                areas, which offer little more than miles of suburban
                sprawl and the occasional shopping mall. "Most of the
                history lies on the other side of the bridge."</p>

              <p>But among some university graduates attitudes are
                changing, Soomro says. "They have started this movement
                of arranging walks around their city because they
                realise they are missing out," he said.</p>

              <p>Even the city's handful of government-supported
                heritage sites are unfamiliar to many. When Soomro
                posted pictures online of the former residence of
                Pakistan's revered founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, he was
                taken aback by the level of interest in what should be
                one of the country's best-known sites.</p>

              Pakistan's revered founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
              Photograph: Karachi Walla </span> </span>
              <p>Despite its well-ordered museum and location near the
                city's international hotels, the building known as
                Flagstaff House, designed by a member of Karachi's now
                vanished Jewish community, attracts only a trickle of
                visitors. There are even fewer callers at Wazir
                Mansion, the single-floor flat where Jinnah's family
                lived when he was a child.</p>

              <p>Even though Jinnah's face appears on banknotes and his
                picture is displayed in public buildings, the custodian
                of Wazir Mansion said visitor numbers had tailed off as
                security declined in the city.</p>

              <p>The narrow streets of Saddar Town, the neighbourhood
                where Jinnah's childhood home is tucked away, are
                considered a no-go area for many.</p>

              <p>The once elegant commercial heart of the city
                gradually lost out as the well-to-do moved out. With
                heritage preservation a low priority, many of the old
                buildings, some of which are little more than grand
                facades, are vulnerable to rapacious "land grabbers".</p>

              <p>Street crime has become rife in a city where gangs,
                often linked to ethnic or political groups, fight
                vicious turf battles.</p>

              <p>A massive influx of people from Pakistan's troubled
                north-west has also attracted <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban" title="More from the Guardian on Taliban">Taliban</a>
                militants, who reportedly control neighbourhoods and
                mete out their brutal form of justice.</p>

              <p>But those who do venture out on Soomro's tours are
                often stunned by what they find. "I'm just in awe right
                now," said Aniya Fatima, a young executive, during a
                Karachi Walla tour of one of the city's churches. "I
                knew there were churches but I didn't know we had
                churches this nice."</p>

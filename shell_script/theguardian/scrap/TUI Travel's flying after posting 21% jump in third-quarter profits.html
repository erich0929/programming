                biggest tour operator by revenues, looks on track to
                meet its annual profit growth goal after a 21% jump in
                third-quarter profits, powered by sales of
                higher-margin holidays.</p>

              <p>It is in talks with German-based TUI AG – which owns
                55% of the British firm – regarding a £4.4bn merger
                deal that would create the world's largest leisure
                tourism group. The companies have until 19 September to
                announce a formal proposal.</p>

              <p>TUI Travel is targeting 7-10% growth in underlying
                operating profit for the 12 months to the end of
                September, but takeover rules prevented it from
                re-affirming guidance on Friday.</p>

              <p>"I can't comment in terms of a forecast for this year
                because we're in an offer period and I've got
                restrictions in terms of the takeover code," its chief
                executive, Peter Long, said. He added that there was
                "no business reason" for the absence of guidance in the
                statement.</p>

              <p>TUI Travel and TUI AG announced a plan to merge in an
                all-share, nil-premium deal in June. Investors had long
                expected such a tie-up since TUI Travel was created in
                2007 from the merger of Britain's First Choice and the
                travel business of TUI AG.</p>

              <p>The two firms last held merger talks in 2013 but a
                deal collapsed after TUI AG said an offer would not
                make sense given their share prices at the time.</p>

              <p>Analysts at the corporate advice firm Numis said the
                current merger plan did not look attractive for
                independent TUI Travel shareholders, given the
                underperformance of TUI AG's share price, and that
                meant either a more favourable deal could emerge or
                that the merger could be scrapped. "Together with
                today's encouraging trading update, this makes us more
                positive on TUI Travel," Wyn Ellis of Numis said.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/shares" title="More from the Guardian on Shares">Shares</a> in
                TUI AG have lost 14% of their value since the day
                before the merger talks were announced, underperforming
                TUI Travel's stock which is trading 9% lower.</p>

              <p>TUI Travel shares traded down 0.8% to 352.75p,
                slightly lagging behind Britain's bluechip index which
                was down 0.7%.</p>

              <p>Long said that TUI Travel's strong performance was
                being driven by its "unique" holiday concept.</p>

              <p>These higher-margin holidays accounted for 71% of
                summer bookings this year and allow TUI Travel to
                differentiate itself from competitors who sell more
                commodity-like holidays, Long explained, adding that
                this was a particular advantage given that the market
                this year was more competitive than last.</p>

              <p>TUI Travel on Friday reported underlying operating
                profit on a like-for-like basis of £92m in the three
                months to 30 June compared with £76m in the same
                period last year.</p>

                  <p> NEW YORK (AP) â Former congressman Anthony
                    Weiner wants to open a restaurant in New York City.
                    </p>

                  <p>The place would be in the Rockaways, a coastal
                    Queens neighborhood that is still recovering from
                    Superstorm Sandy in 2012. It would be named The
                    Rockaway Restoration Kitchen and offer locally
                    sourced food.</p>

                  <p>Weiner is listed on the restaurant's Idealist.org
                    job listing page, and The Rockaway Times reports
                    he's scouted locations.</p>

                  <p>Weiner resigned his seat in Congress in 2011 after
                    admitting he sent explicit photos to women who were
                    not his wife.</p>

                  <p>He ran for mayor last year and led the field
                    before more sexting allegations sank his bid.</p>

                  <p>He has been working as a pundit and consultant.</p>

                  <p>The Rockaways were part of his former
                    congressional district.</p>

              <p>Leo Stein said of Picasso that he was "just completely
                there … more real than most people". This book is
                also just completely there. Like the Catalan sardana, a
                dance, as Picasso told Braque, that is "a communion of
                souls … each step must be counted … rich and poor,
                young and old, dance it together," here they are, all
                the very different characters in a group biography that
                manages not to miss any steps. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/22/1" title="">André Derain</a> stands out in&nbsp;his tall
                lankiness, with his outfits varying from&nbsp;his
                Collioure period of all white with a red beret, to his
                dandyish English tweeds with his red and green ties in
                his Montmartre period, to his thick woollen sweaters on
                the Rue Bonaparte. <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/maurice-de-vlaminck-2109" title="">Maurice de Vlaminck</a> – with&nbsp;his
                powerful body, blue eyes, flaming red hair, red scarf
                and a painted wooden necktie – joins Derain. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso" title="">Pablo Picasso</a> and the curly-haired <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/braque" title="">Georges Braque</a> – both enchanted with
                Wilbur Wright and the idea of flight, experimenting
                with paper sculptures as "flying machines" – take to
                wearing "Vilbours": replicas of Wright's peaked green
                cap (Braque was even nicknamed "Vilbour"). Both also
                wore the cloche hats Braque had found at Le Havre,
                their sideburns smudged with burnt cork alongside their
                false moustaches. Costumes count.</p>

              <p>We see these four as the original Bande à Picasso, as
                they are swaggering along the Montmartre streets, then
                Derain and Vlaminck going in another direction as they
                split off from Braque and Picasso, who begin doing
                their cubist stuff. On that much discussed topic, Sue
                Roe is to the point. Matisse had wanted to show, the
                story goes, that one of Braque's paintings of the roofs
                of L'Estaque consisted of "petites cubes" – one of
                the origins of the term "cubism". Roe of course has
                much more on the term, and enlists the handheld fan as
                the symbolic object in&nbsp;cubist painting, enfolding
                as it does differing points of visual contact in a
                concertinaed form.</p>

              <p>She has the gift of painting close-up descriptions and
                scenes. I can see, right&nbsp;now, Manolo the sculptor
                who never sculpted (he said he couldn't afford
                the&nbsp;materials), André Salmon the writer, and
                everyone's favourite early 20th-century French poet,
                Guillaume Apollinaire, going up the hillside to the Rue
                Ravignan (justly celebrated by the poet Max Jacob and
                the painter Juan Gris) to meet Picasso. It is an
                unforgettable picture. (A small quarrel: I&nbsp;don't
                believe we can use the term "concrete" about those
                poets, as Roe&nbsp;does in her statement "and, soon
                afterwards, Pierre Reverdy, would soon&nbsp;be
                producing concrete poetry based on contingency and
                juxtaposition…" Concrete poetry is something else
                again, and is its own genre.)</p>

              <p>Roe is skilled at selecting the telling detail while
                continuing the sweep of the&nbsp;thing: Maurice Princet
                tearing up his wife Alice's fur coat when she goes off
                with Derain; Derain picking up his umbrella in
                Collioure as a mark of his leaving; Margot Asquith
                showing her violet knickers as she enters Paul Poiret's
                salon; Marie Laurencin fencing in Poiret's specially
                designed costume with an eyeglass in one hand and
                the&nbsp;foil in the other; Gertrude Stein dropping all
                her books on the floor to&nbsp;stop Leo Stein's endless
                flow of explanation about Picasso's paintings. The
                continuity isn't arrested: like Stein's endless flow
                it&nbsp;is,&nbsp;rather, enhanced.</p>

              <p>And her retellings are often arresting. Cézanne,
                always thinking about how to represent his sitters,
                once said that if he asked someone to pose "like an
                apple" it was so he could paint "a head like a door".
                This seemingly mysterious statement might imply
                that&nbsp;his celebrated paintings of apples open, for
                him as well as for those of us&nbsp;looking at them, on
                to somewhere inside the visible exterior.</p>

              <p>Roe also captures the drama of various scenes: for
                instance, the "mellow opium evenings" in the
                Bateau-Lavoir ending abruptly when Karl-Heinz Wiegels,
                overdoing it with opium, hashish and ether, was found
                hanging by Picasso – his "bande" swore they would
                never touch opium again.</p>

              <p>Diving into any book based on art and place is bound
                to arouse particular responses according to the reader.
                So, for me, to read about Collioure, the tiny "town of
                artists" that I know well, with its ancient trade in
                anchovies, where Matisse and Derain engaged in&nbsp;the
                "flat" treatment of "la couleur pour&nbsp;la couleur",
                is already preparing an emotional ground. It is here
                that Matisse painted <em>La Bonheur de Vivre</em>, and
                Derain his <em>Bateaux à Collioure</em>. Equally, to
                read about the "blond, gilded light, which suppresses
                the shadows", as Matisse writes to Vlaminck, and then
                to come across the&nbsp;simple sentence that "in 1905,
                summer came early" gives the same kind of whack to the
                emotions as the first words of Hemingway's <em>A
                Moveable&nbsp;Feast</em>: "Then there was the bad
                weather" – the weather and the light differ, but the
                "then" and the "1905" say a lot about Paris and
                Collioure, if your mind is slanted that way.</p>

              <p>Among the admirable transitions is&nbsp;the one from
                place to place, from Montmartre to Montparnasse, from
                street to street, cafe to nightclub, so the Lapin Agile
                and the eccentric Frédé and his donkey Lolo come as
                alive as&nbsp;Maurice Utrillo and my favourite Suzanne
                Valadon, Utrillo's mother and the most far-out painter
                imaginable – she also posed for Pierre-Auguste
                Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and, though it's not
                mentioned here, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. In 1909,
                shooing away her husband, she took a&nbsp;lover, André
                Utter, 21 years younger than herself, and lived with
                him and her son as "the diabolic trinity".</p>

              <p>What an eye for art Roe has: she doesn't spin out
                unduly the descriptions, but you feel the presence of
                the work. I loved knowing that the one painting Derain
                would not part with was his copy of Ghirlandaio's
                <em>Bearing the Cross</em>, that Matisse kept
                Cézanne's <em>Three Bathers </em>right above his
                easel, and that his portrait of his wife hung right
                above Gertrude Stein's writing desk.</p>

              <p>Of course, Picasso's <em>Demoiselles d'Avignon</em>
                makes an appearance – it's an&nbsp;icon of the 20th
                century, and we're still held captive by it. Picasso
                had called it "Le Bordel", and it was Salmon who
                renamed it. Is it a response, an "anarchic retort", to
                Matisse's Arcadian ideal of the immense <a href="http://www.henrimatisse.org/le-luxe.jsp" title=""><em>Le Luxe</em></a> of 1907? Picasso painted
                it alone, never showing it, and it remained out of
                sight for 16 years. He said of it later: "You have
                to&nbsp;give whoever is looking at it the means of
                painting the nude himself with his eyes."</p>

              <p>Some of the most colourful chapters&nbsp;take us to
                Matisse and Derain and Vlaminck delighting in the
                bright colours and the broad rhythmical patterns of the
                water, as in Collioure. In&nbsp;1907, Matisse went back
                to that beloved place, as he often did, where he made a
                vivid and vibrant study of <em>La Musique</em>,
                studying spatial design, in&nbsp;intuitive preparation
                for the immense expanse of <em>La Danse</em>. As, even
                now, we&nbsp;watch that round of a farandole, we're
                still gripped by the story of the dialogue between
                Picasso and Matisse – we Picassoites and Matissites
                – and by this book's own brilliant dance.</p>

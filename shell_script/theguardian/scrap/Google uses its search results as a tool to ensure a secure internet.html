                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Google is to demote sites in its search results
                    which don’t use secure connections by default.</p>

                  <p>Webmasters will have to enable HTTPS, a method of
                    browsing the internet which prevents eavesdroppers
                    from reading the communication between the server
                    and visitor, or risk losing their positions on
                    Google search results to other sites who do.</p>

                  <p>“Over the past few months we’ve been running
                    tests taking into account whether sites use secure,
                    encrypted connections as a signal in our search
                    ranking algorithms,” <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">the
                    company explains on its Webmaster Central blog</a>
                    “We’ve seen positive results, so we’re
                    starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal.”</p>

                  <p>HTTPS, also known as HTTP over TLS, is the most
                    common security standard on the internet. Many will
                    know it from its use on e-commerce sites and online
                    banking, where they have been trained to look for a
                    padlock symbol in their browser to ensure that a
                    site is safe.</p>

                  <p>But the privacy groups have long been calling for
                    HTTPS to be used everywhere – even on websites
                    which, at first glance, don’t need to offer the
                    same level of protection to their visitors as
                    banking might.</p>

                  <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which makes a
                    plugin that lets users easily enable HTTPS on sites
                    which don’t offer it by default, <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq/">explains
                    the advantage</a>: “Ideally, this provides some
                    protection against an attacker learning the content
                    of the information flowing in each direction —
                    for instance, the text of e-mail messages you send
                    or receive through a webmail site, the products you
                    browse or purchase on an e-commerce site, or the
                    particular articles you read on a reference
                    site.”</p>

                  <p>For the time being, Google won’t be penalising
                    sites heavily if they don’t enable HTTPS. The
                    company describes it as “a very lightweight
                    signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global
                    queries, and carrying less weight than other
                    signals such as high-quality content”. But once
                    webmasters have been given time to switch their
                    sites over, the search firm warns that “we may
                    decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to
                    encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to
                    HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.”</p>

                  <p>“Data in a plain-text state is easily
                    readable,” says Jason Hart, the vice president of
                    of Cloud Solutions, at cybersecurity firm <a href="http://www.safenet-inc.com/">SafeNet</a>,
                    “so any website that’s storing or transmitting
                    user credentials or data in plain-text is putting
                    customers’ data, and the company’s reputation,
                    at risk.</p>

                  <p>“Previously organisations have shied away from
                    encryption due to cost concerns or fears of slowing
                    website response times. But there are now high
                    speed encryption technologies available that mean
                    cost and speed need no longer be an issue. So there
                    really is no excuse for any data to be transmitted
                    or stored in plain text.”</p>

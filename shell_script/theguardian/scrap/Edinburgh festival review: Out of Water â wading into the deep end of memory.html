<div id="article-body-blocks">
          <p>Taking place just after dawn or before dusk on Portobello
            Beach, this piece by Helen Paris and Caroline Wright, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/23/agnes-jacket-jocelyn-pook-hearing-voices" title="">with a score by Jocelyn Pook</a>, offers a poetic
            and musical meditation on how easily we can end up all at
            sea. It's a wonderful melding of performance and landscape,
            the sky blushing silvery-pink as we wander across the beach
            towards the pewter ocean, which meets the shore like a line
            drawn in charcoal in a child's wonky hand. Awaiting us are
            a group of sailors in white shirts and royal-blue culottes,
            a rope at their feet.</p>

          <p>Through headphones we hear voices. At first, the shipping
            forecast, then some instructions on how to conduct
            mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Then the memories of a woman,
            now out of her depth, recalling her mother's attempts long
            ago to teach her to swim. The rope becomes a timeline in
            which past, present and future coexist. We began as fish,
            so do we now flounder on dry land? The waves ripple against
            the shore, gulls wheel in the sky, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/21/falmouth-sea-shanty-festival-folk" title="">the timeless heave-ho of a sea shanty</a> reminds
            us of the endless push and pull of time. "Her ageing pushes
            her back," says the woman of her elderly mother. "My
            children's ageing pushes me forward."</p>

          <p>The setting is spectacular and, cocooned in your
            headphones, there's a sense of experiencing something
            secret, although not quite fully formed. It's the setting
            – the infinite horizon that makes you long to strike out
            and swim towards it – rather than the content that makes
            Out of Water precious and memorable.</p>

          <p>Just when you think it is doing too little, and too
            slowly, it suddenly bursts into life, focusing on the
            behaviour of geese who can fly 70% further in a V formation
            than they can alone. When one in the group tires and must
            rest, the others drop out to tend it. The sun finds its
            warmth on the back of your neck, and as you stare out to
            sea you view a remarkable glimpse of humanity. Not
            drowning, but walking resolutely towards the future.</p>

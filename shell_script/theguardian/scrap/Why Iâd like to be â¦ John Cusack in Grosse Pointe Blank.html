                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>I was too young to connect to the brimmingly
                    sensitive John Cusack an entire generation fell
                    for: I was but seven at the time of 1985’s The
                    Sure Thing, and 11 when Lloyd Dobler raised his
                    boombox to Ione Skye in 1989’s Say Anything. The
                    Cusack I tuned into was the slightly bruised figure
                    visible by the end of the century: the lovelorn Rob
                    of 2000’s High Fidelity, a film engineered so as
                    to rhyme with <em>any</em> boyish pop-lover’s
                    romantic ups-and-downs; before that, the hitman of
                    1997’s Grosse Pointe Blank, which may stand as
                    the greatest romantic comedy ever conceived with
                    the male viewer in mind, in that it features one
                    character being bloodily skewered with a Biro, and
                    another with a job sourcing mildly obscure 80s
                    vinyl.</p>

                  <p>There’s a scene two-thirds of the way through
                    the latter film that gets me every time – an
                    unexpectedly tender interlude between the
                    bloodletting and sharp-edged social satire. Our
                    ambiguous hero, the self-improving assassin Martin
                    Q. Blank (Cusack), has retreated to a balcony
                    overlooking his high-school reunion with DJ Debi
                    Newberry (Minnie Driver), the sweetheart he
                    abandoned on prom night. To the sound of Pete
                    Townshend’s Let My Love Open The Door, the pair
                    begin to pick over some unfinished personal
                    business.</p>

                  <p>“I think I was overly harsh when I said you were
                    broken,” offers Debi, by way of conciliation.
                    “I don’t think you’re broken. I think
                    you’re mildly sprained. Nothing that can’t be
                    mended.”</p>

                  <p>“Sorry if I fucked up your life,” Martin
                    ventures, perhaps sensing how that “if” might
                    be superfluous.</p>

                  <p>“It’s not over yet.”</p>

                  <p>In a film that posits contract killing as a
                    metaphor for the damage we can wreak whenever we
                    get close to someone, the scene works because it
                    opens up the possibility of change and redemption
                    – that a partner might recognise our pain and
                    forgive us all previous trespasses. Grosse Pointe
                    Blank is a peculiarly potent watch for men because
                    the script, written by Cusack with Steve Pink, DV
                    DeVincentis and Tom Jankiewicz, on some level
                    acknowledges all our worst instincts: the desire
                    (often misplaced) to put the world to rights, the
                    anger that can shade over into murderous
                    aggression, the persistent need to do something,
                    anything, with our fists, our dicks, a gun –
                    because that’s what we’ve been hardwired to do.</p>

                  <p>Blank’s temporary solution has been to isolate
                    himself, first on prom night, now as an
                    “independent contractor”. Note Cusack’s
                    distinctive walk: fast, clipped, guarded, one hand
                    forever poised on the pistol in his pocket. He is,
                    however, more vulnerable than threatening: though
                    he insists his were deserving victims (“You
                    should read the files on some of these
                    fuckers!”), we see the toll this lonely life has
                    taken in the dark rings beneath his eyes, and how
                    he comes alive again circling Debi. Cusack and
                    Driver were a thing once upon a time, and their
                    chemistry remains a joy: not just affectionate and
                    sexy but regenerative, suggestive of all manner of
                    blanks being filled. My inchoate late-adolescent
                    self couldn’t help but aspire to that.</p>

                  <p>For some while, there was talk of a follow-up –
                    perhaps one in which Martin Blank finds
                    spirituality? But, really, who needs God when you
                    have Debi Newberry? Instead, we got 2008’s War,
                    Inc, a spiritual sequel in which Cusack played a
                    Blankish contractor stalking the Middle East; its
                    Bush-bashing got blunt, and it missed Driver, for
                    all the zip Hilary Duff brought to her role as the
                    Yemeni Britney Spears. There may nevertheless be
                    something equally instructive in the morally
                    compromised figure Cusack now cuts on screen:
                    consider his greasy killer in The Paperboy, The
                    Frozen Ground’s curdled misogynist, or his
                    sweaty, vote-grabbing Nixon in The Butler.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Grosse Pointe Blank – work less, make                   more" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WinsZdTm-a0">
                  <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WinsZdTm-a0" width="460"></iframe> </figure>
                  <p>Where earlier Cusack characters displayed a
                    puppy-eyed idealism, here are men tainted by
                    exactly those grim compulsions Grosse Pointe Blank
                    diagnoses. They reflect what might have happened to
                    Martin Blank if he hadn’t met Debi Newberry, and
                    his hurt hadn’t healed; if he’d given into the
                    worst aspects of his nature, and gone more or less
                    entirely to seed.</p>

                  <p>We don’t all wind up bombing Cambodia or
                    masturbating in front of Nicole Kidman, thankfully,
                    but in Cusack’s recent reinvention as a prolific
                    character actor, there lurks a valuable warning
                    about what can happen to us once the dewy sheen of
                    youth has evaporated.</p>

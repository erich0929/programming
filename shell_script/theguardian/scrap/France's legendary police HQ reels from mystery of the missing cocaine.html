              <p>The word most often used to describe the imposing 36
                Quai des Orfèvres – France's equivalent to Scotland
                Yard – is <em>mythique,</em> or legendary. Home to
                the Police Judiciare, nicknamed <em>les flics</em>, the
                building flanking the river Seine at the heart of Paris
                has been the backdrop for films, novels and television
                series broadcast around the world.</p>

              <p>Commissioner Maigret, the celebrated pipe-smoking
                detective created by Georges Simenon, roamed its
                labyrinthine "damp, cold and airless" corridors, as did
                actors Gérard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil in the film
                named after the building. British viewers will be more
                familiar with the name through the travails of Captain
                Laure Berthaud in the French series Spiral (Engrenages)
                on BBC4.</p>

              <p>These fictional fighters of crime and corruption,
                however, might have struggled to solve what might be
                titled The Mystery of the Missing Cocaine, which is
                making 36 Quai des Orfèvres look more lackadaisical
                than legendary.</p>

              <p>A week after an officer from the drugs squad – known
                as <em>les stups</em> – was arrested and accused of
                strolling into the police headquarters one evening and
                coolly strolling out again with 52.6kg of cocaine in
                two holdalls, fact is proving stranger and more
                impenetrable than fiction.</p>

              <p>Investigators are puzzled how a thief could have
                removed the drugs, packaged in 48 foil wrapped "bricks"
                and with a street value of more than €2m, from a
                triple-locked high-security room to which only three
                senior officers supposedly had the key. And they are
                perplexed why one of their own, who knew the building,
                the procedures and the position of CCTV cameras, would
                apparently do so.</p>

              <p>"Incredulous is the word," one officer said.</p>

              <p>The cocaine had been seized on 4 July in the 18th
                arrondissement of Paris during a raid on a drug-dealing
                network. A few days later, the bricks were sealed,
                labelled and locked in the high-security seized
                evidence room by one of the three senior officers –
                the police chief of staff, his deputy and the head of
                the drug brigade – who have access.</p>

              <p>The rules are strictly applied: officers who wish to
                enter the so-called "yellow room" have to sign a
                request stating the object of their visit and be
                accompanied by a key holder.</p>

              <p>On 31 July, the cocaine was missing. The door and lock
                of the yellow room were intact.</p>

              <p>The Interior ministry's police investigations team,
                the IGPN, known as the "police's police", were summoned
                and found CCTV footage of an officer arriving at 36
                Quai des Orfèves late on 24 July with two apparently
                empty bags and leaving shortly afterwards with two
                bulging bags. A female officer in the guardroom
                reported seeing the officer, and colleagues identified
                him from the video.</p>

              <p>Records allegedly show he made what an investigator
                described as a "feeble excuse" to visit the sealed room
                shortly before the drugs disappeared.</p>

              <p>On Saturday, Jonathan Guyot, a 33-year-old drug squad
                officer, was arrested while shopping in the southern
                French city of Perpignan, where he was born, with his
                wife and 11-month-old daughter. In his backpack, the
                arresting officers allegedly found €16,020 in cash. A
                further €8,790 in cash was found at his Paris home.
                They were large sums for a policeman earning at most
                €2,000 a month. He was found to own two properties in
                Perpignon and five small studio flats in Paris.</p>

              <p>Guyot's arrest stupefied colleagues. He was described
                as <em>beau gosse</em> (handsome), sporty, hardworking
                but discreet, and a model police officer with a good
                record.</p>

              <p>After four days of questioning, he was brought before
                a judge and put under formal investigation, the
                equivalent of being charged, over the theft of the
                cocaine. No trace of the drugs has been found.</p>

              <p>Guyot has denied the charge and said he won the cash
                found in his rucksack gambling online, a claim
                confirmed by his younger brother Jérémy, who was with
                Guyot shortly before his arrest.</p>

              <p>"He was calm and was on holiday. He said they wouldn't
                find anything against him," Jérémy said. "It's
                ridiculous that he would steal that from 36 [Quai des
                Orfèvres] … he's not a big spender, he doesn't
                particularly need money, and the money he earns
                honestly."</p>

              <p>Investigators are now looking for possible
                accomplices. A second drug squad officer, aged 30, was
                arrested and released on the equivalent of police bail,
                and a member of the French border police, who allegedly
                had been in contact with Guyot, presented himself for
                questioning.</p>

              <p>In an unexpected twist, sniffer dogs brought in to
                check a garage allegedly linked to the suspect found no
                trace of cocaine – but uncovered 200kg of cannabis
                resin in a neighbouring lockup.</p>

              <p>A French crime reporter working on the story told the
                Guardian the theft had echoes of the spectacular heist
                carried out by Toni Musulin, a Frenchman of Serbo-Croat
                origins who in November 2009 stole €11.6m from an
                armoured security van he was driving. Police later
                found €9.1m behind a false wall of a garage. Musulin,
                who turned himself in, admitted stealing the money, and
                was convicted and jailed. He was released in September
                last year, but €2.5m of the stolen money has never
                been found.</p>

              <p>"It's all very strange. Whatever the reputation of 36
                Quai des Orfèvres, things don't just disappear like
                that," said the journalist, who did not want to be
                named.</p>

              <p>"There are three sorts of evidence that are a real
                headache to deal with – money, drugs and weapons –
                and they are put under seal and closely guarded. But if
                the drugs are not found, if there are no suspicious
                movements of money and all the police have for evidence
                is the silhouette of someone on a CCTV camera, that's
                not going to get a conviction.</p>

              <p>"I have no idea how this story is going to finish. I'm
                not sure the police have either."</p>

                  <p>Associated Press= SEATTLE (AP) â Now that
                    authorities believe they have found the body of a
                    6-year-old Washington girl who vanished from her
                    home last weekend, they are focusing on a criminal
                    investigation of the death.</p>

                  <p>A planned autopsy by a forensic pathologist and
                    painstaking examination and mapping of the wooded
                    spot where the body was found are among the tools
                    they will use.</p>

                  <p>The body believed to be that of Jenise Wright was
                    found Thursday in woods near the Bremerton-area
                    mobile home park where she lived. The FBI's
                    Specialty Search Dogs Unit discovered the body
                    after volunteer canine search teams reported their
                    dogs showed interest in a particular area, Kitsap
                    County sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said.</p>

                  <p>The girl's family was notified.</p>

                  <p>Formal identification of the body was expected
                    Friday, Wilson said.</p>

                  <p>In a statement, the sheriff's department said a
                    coroner will make official confirmation of the
                    identity, but "it appears that the body is that of
                    Jenise."</p>

                  <p>"This is going to be a criminal investigation,
                    there's no doubt about that," Wilson told a news
                    briefing Thursday. Authorities are trying to track
                    down anyone responsible, and they're "not ruling
                    out anything," he said.</p>

                  <p>Determination of the manner and cause of death is
                    pending, Wilson said, but "we suspect that she just
                    did not go off by herself and fall into some bushes
                    and die."</p>

                  <p>There have been no arrests in the case,
                    authorities said.</p>

                  <p>A forensic pathologist under contract to the
                    county will perform the autopsy, Wilson said.</p>

                  <p>Jenise was last seen when she went to bed Saturday
                    night. Her parents waited a day before calling for
                    help because they say the girl had wandered around
                    the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the
                    past. She was outgoing and unafraid to talk to
                    anyone, family said.</p>

                  <p>Wilson said in an interview Thursday that there
                    were no signs of forced entry at the girl's home
                    and no indication that she was taken from her room.

                  <p>An FBI evidence research team has finished
                    checking the area where the body was found, and a
                    forensic mapping team from the Washington State
                    Patrol's criminal investigation division planned to
                    map the spot, Wilson said Thursday evening.</p>

                  <p>The girl's parents are cooperating with
                    authorities, he said.</p>

                  <p>More than 350 people, including officers from 15
                    law enforcement agencies, searched for Jenise,
                    going door to door at Steele Creek Mobile Home Park
                    on the west side of Puget Sound, across from
                    Seattle.</p>

                  <p>They also pulled surveillance video from nearby
                    businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the
                    county.</p>

                  <p>After the search began, state child welfare
                    workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old
                    boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home.</p>

                  <p>Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged
                    more than a decade ago with molesting two girls,
                    ages 8 and 15, court records show.</p>

                  <p>He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County
                    Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor
                    assault charge related to the older girl. It was
                    not immediately clear why the molestation charges
                    were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return
                    calls.</p>

                  <p>A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced
                    Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire
                    jail term on the condition that he follow certain
                    conditions, including paying fees.</p>

                  <p>Wilson said at a news briefing Wednesday that
                    authorities were aware of the past charge against
                    the father, but that officers were focused on
                    finding the girl.</p>

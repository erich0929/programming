              <p>There have been 67 Edinburgh Festivals, but this
                year's represents a first and a last: the arts jamboree
                has never before overlapped with a Commonwealth Games
                in the rival city of Glasgow, and if <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scotland">Scotland</a>
                votes yes to independence next month Edinburgh will
                cease to be part of the UK cultural scene and become a
                "foreign" festival like the one in Avignon.</p>

              <p>This fear that the real theatre is elsewhere is
                perhaps why the city has seemed jittery during the
                first week of the festival. Even with more than 3,000
                shows to choose from, was it possible that Edinburgh
                had already been beaten across the line by a closing
                weekend of Glaswegian drama from Usain Bolt and Lulu?</p>

              <p>And how strange it felt to be sitting in the Traverse
                theatre on Tuesday evening watching a play about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence" title="More from the Guardian on Scottish                 independence">Scottish independence</a> while knowing
                that nothing on stage could match the urgent dialogue
                taking place live on TV in the first debate between the
                first minister, Alex Salmond, and Alistair Darling.</p>

              <p>The climate may also have subdued the mood. If this is
                the last UK festival, then the future Independent
                Scottish Tourist Board would be unwise to use footage
                of Edinburgh filmed this week.</p>

              <p>In the first days of the festival the bands on Princes
                Street and the Royal Mile became tired of the irony of
                striking up Singing in the Rain as the Pac a Macs were
                unfurled. As rain shrouded the castle and university,
                it was almost impossible to see the buildings, but what
                suddenly became apparent with dazzling clarity was the
                influence of Edinburgh's high, dark, skyline on the
                architecture of Hogwarts Castle, JK Rowling's creation.</p>

              <p>Under the ever expanding umbrella of the Fringe, there
                is the usual nightmare of variety. Some shows
                acknowledge new ways of seeing theatre. Two titles have
                allusions to non-sightedness: Blind Hamlet, by the
                Actors Touring Company, is an interactive experience
                billed as the first Edinburgh show without actors,
                while City of the Blind, at the Traverse, takes place
                entirely online. Though, if the play is in cyberspace,
                why be in Edinburgh?</p>

              <p>Most companies are more old-fashioned in approach and
                promotion. On every inch of wall or railing, posters
                plead for notice, betting mainly on an arresting title
                containing a cultural pun – The Curious Incident of
                the Frog in My Sightline – or a festival
                self-reference such as Gavin Webster's A Controversial
                Title in Order To Sell Tickets.</p>

              <p>Tim Vine, now the festival's most reliably popular
                comedian for taking wordplay to new levels of
                punishment, has gone this time for the Poppins
                provoked: Timtiminee Timtiminee Tim Tim to You.</p>

              <p>With so many theatre companies at the festival, some
                have inevitably chosen the same subject, allowing
                veterans to play the game of Edinburgh Fringe football
                scores. This year's results include Candide 2–Dracula
                2; Antigone 3–The Duchess of Malfi 2; and, for those
                drawn to biographical shows, a 2-2 draw between Gordon
                Brown and Tony Benn.</p>

              <p>But, perhaps surprisingly in a year when possible
                national regime change is such a talking point, the
                Scottish Play suffers a shock defeat to a Scandanavian
                challenger: Macbeth 8–Hamlet 9.</p>

              <p>Unusually, even such high scoring Shakespeareans have
                no chance this summer of making the final play-off for
                frequency of subject matter, which, by my count, ends:
                first world war centenary 16–Scottish independence
                referendum 24.</p>

              <p>Most of those referendum shows are voting yes,
                although the comedian Bruce Fummey resourcefully offers
                a pair of contradictory shows each evening: Aaah'm
                Voting YES and Aaah'm Voting NO.</p>

              <p>A Split Decision, an inventive verse satire by Keir
                McAllister, performed at the Assembly Rooms, presents
                the two potentially separating nations as a divorcing
                couple: Scotland a hard-drinking and swearing bruiser
                in a tartan suit, England a rude, superior, statuesque
                scowler in a blue dress. Their son tries to referee a
                reconciliation, but the pair can find no mutual respect
                except that she relies on him to keep her cars running
                and she's quite fond of his whisky and shortbread.</p>

              <p>Curiously, the two most high profile plays on
                independence both involve preparations for a political
                speech. The actor and activist David Hayman, in Chris
                Dolan's monologue The Pitiless Storm, is a retiring
                Scottish Labour MP, offered the OBE as a farewell
                present, who agonises over whether to break ranks with
                Labour for the first time in his career and support
                independence.</p>

              <p>Strikingly, Hayman's character is driven to breakdown
                by David Bowie lyrics lodged in his head. The actor
                opens up a Q&amp;A session with the audience after the
                show, so I asked him if the presentation of the pop
                star as an irritant was payback for Bowie's recent
                intervention on behalf of the Better Together campaign.
                Hayman admitted that the script had been written very
                recently and so the musical running gag was unlikely to
                be a coincidence.</p>

              <p>At the Traverse, which remains, at least until
                September, the best new-writing theatre in Britain, the
                play Spoiled, by John McCann, is set after a separatist
                vote for Scotland. A pregnant and hungover Scottish
                foreign minister designate discusses with a new aide
                the speech she will make alongside Her Britannic
                Majesty's principal secretary for foreign affairs at
                the launch of a cooperation agreement between the UK
                rump and Free Scotland. As her aide is from Belfast,
                this play intriguingly explores a subject little
                considered in England: the political and psychological
                consequences for Ireland if Scotland breaks with the
                union first.</p>

              <p>A peculiarity of this pre-referendum festival is that,
                whether consciously or subconsciously, even the dramas
                that aren't explicitly about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scottish                 politics">Scottish politics</a> seem to have as their
                theme the meanings of loyalty and treachery.</p>

              <p>Mark Thomas's monologue Cuckooed, at the Traverse,
                examines the comedian's betrayal by a fellow anti-arms
                activist who proves to be a spy for an arms company. At
                the same venue Owen McCafferty's drama Unfaithful is a
                modern version of Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde, in
                which a married couple and their respective sexual
                temptations are seen in various permutations, lying
                with, and lying to, each other. The message of both
                plays is "trust no one", which seems to suit the
                country's divided mood.</p>

              <p>Yet another production about distrust, The Trial of
                Jane Fonda, which sketchily and sentimentally
                dramatises a 1988 confrontation in Connecticut between
                Vietnam veterans and the American actor they accuse of
                supporting their enemy, proves the gloomy usual rule of
                a festival first week – that some of the worst shows
                get some of the biggest audiences.</p>

              <p>Because of the ticket-selling power of the film star
                Anne Archer, you were lucky to get a seat in Assembly
                Rooms for The Trial of Jane Fonda.</p>

              <p>But you could sit wherever you wanted for far more
                inventive foreign imports with no star, such as Blood
                at the Root, a fact-based play about a racial dispute
                at an American high school, brought here by the Penn
                State School of Theatre; or Black Faggot, a
                swaggeringly acted comedy about racial and sexual
                attitudes in Oceania, which is part of a New Zealand
                season.</p>

              <p>A further reason that theatre has to fight for
                audiences is that drama is increasingly crowded into
                mornings and afternoons to leave the evenings free for
                comedy. But in the joke zone as well, the range is
                extraordinary: from 23-year-old Old Etonian Ivo Graham
                to 60-year-old Jim Davidson, alumnus of St Austin's
                school, Charlton, south London.</p>

              <p>In subject matter, too, the spread runs from
                Davidson's fanny gags to the feminist routine of
                Bridget Christie.</p>

              <p>The surprise of Davidson's set is that it involves his
                coming out as a Scot, devoting much of his first
                Edinburgh Festival appearance to his Glaswegian father.</p>

              <p>On the night I went, Davidson had answered yes to the
                classic Edinburgh dilemma of whether to respond to
                critics: "Three shows, three standing ovations, three
                shitty reviews!" But, despite his paternal heritage, he
                was one of the very few 2014 performers not to offer a
                view on independence, the subject that overshadows
                everything.</p>

              <p>At the Scottish National Portrait Gallery there is a
                retrospective of paintings by the great Scots
                artist-playwright John Byrne, including studies of the
                young and old Billy Connolly and Robbie Coltrane.</p>

              <p>Byrne would be the obvious choice to paint the
                official portrait of Scotland's first independent prime
                minister and, after 18 September, we will know if the
                commission is a possibility and whether Edinburgh 2014
                will be ranked alongside the Berlin Film Festival of
                1990 as a last artistic gathering under the old order.</p>

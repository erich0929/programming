              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian" title="More from the Guardian on The Guardian">The
                Guardian</a> was named newspaper of the year at the
                press awards for its reporting on government
                surveillance.</p>

              <p>The prize was one of a host given to the Guardian and
                its journalists, with theguardian.com handed the
                digital award and the writers Rob Evans, Paul Lewis and
                Patrick Kingsley all honoured at the ceremony in
                London.</p>

              <p>The judges said the Guardian "broke a story of global
                significance that went to the heart of the debate on
                press freedom. The fact that the coverage polarised
                opinion even within the press showed how important it
                was.</p>

              <p>"The job of a newspaper is to speak truth to power and
                the past year has seen the Guardian do this with will
                and verve."</p>

              <p>After the ceremony, held by the Society of Editors in
                London, the Editor in Chief of Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers" title="More from the Guardian on                 Newspapers">Newspapers</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/alanrusbridger" title="More from the Guardian on Alan Rusbridger">Alan
                Rusbridger</a> toasted whistleblowers and dedicated the
                newspaper of the year award to former Guardian deputy
                editor Georgina Henry. Henry, who launched Comment is
                Free in 2006, died this year aged 53.</p>

              <p>Rusbridger said: "It's a great honour for the Guardian
                to be named newspaper of the year by a jury of our
                peers. The story was not, in the end, publishable out
                of London and I want in particular to thank colleagues
                on ProPublica and the New York Times for collaborating
                with us. The support of editors and press freedom
                bodies around the world was also crucial.</p>

              <p>"I want to acknowledge the personal cost to Edward
                Snowden involved in his decision to become a
                whistleblower. I must thank a team of extremely
                talented colleagues on the Guardian. And I dedicate the
                award to our friend and former deputy editor, Georgina
                Henry, who died recently."</p>

              <p>As well as its coverage of the Snowden revelations,
                the judges were impressed by theguardian.com's
                innovative reporting of the Holmes family's desperate
                attempts to escape the Tasmanian firestorm, among other
                projects.</p>

              <p>The digital award was accepted by network editors
                Emily Wilson and Clare Margetson, who also dedicated it
                to Georgina Henry.</p>

              <p>Evans and Lewis won the news reporter of the year
                category for their work on undercover policing ,
                including the revelation that police spied on the
                family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence and that
                police spies stole the identities of dead children in
                order to carry out the work.</p>

              <p>Kingsley was named young reporter of the year for his
                work in Egypt. He reported on accusations of war crimes
                against the country's military, and the men behind the
                Muslim Brotherhood, which was central to the Arab
                Spring, but later became the target of violent
                protests.</p>

              <p>Highly commended by the judges were the Guardian's Ian
                Jack in the broadsheet columnist category, which was
                won by the Financial Times' Gillian Tett; and Peter
                Bradshaw in the critics field, with the Rowan Moore of
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theobserver" title="More from the Guardian on The Observer">the
                Observer</a> taking home the award.</p>

              <p>The Guardian was also highly commended for its work on
                the Snowden files in the scoop of the year category.</p>

              <p>The Observer's Chris Riddell was highly commended in
                the cartoonist category, which was won by the Times'
                Peter Brookes.</p>

              <p>The Observer's Tech Monthly supplement was also highly
                commended by the judges.</p>

              <p>The prize for best front page went to the Sunday
                People for its picture of Charles Saatchi grabbing
                Nigella Lawson's throat, and the Mail on Sunday's story
                exposing then Co-operative Bank chief Paul Flowers was
                named scoop of the year.</p>

              <p>The Mail also won the award for news team of the year,
                while the prize for best sports team went to the Times.
                The prestigious Cudlipp Award went to the London
                Evening Standard.</p>

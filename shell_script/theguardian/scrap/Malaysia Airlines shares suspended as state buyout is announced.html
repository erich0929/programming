                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Malaysia Airlines shares have been suspended and
                    the beleaguered company will be taken entirely into
                    state hands after it was hit by two disasters that
                    killed hundreds of people.</p>

                  <p>Trading of shares in Malaysia Airline System Bhd
                    (MAS) was suspended on Monday morning and the
                    company soon afterwards announced it would be
                    removed from the stock market.</p>

                  <p>The suspension of shares is the first step in
                    plans by Khazanah Nasional Bhd to take MAS private
                    as the first step in a major restructuring. The
                    state investor already owns 69% of MAS.</p>

                  <p>Khazanah Nasional said it planned to buy out
                    minority shareholders at a premium to the
                    airline’s recent share price. Khazanah will offer
                    27 Malaysian sen for each share in the company it
                    does not own, amounting to nearly 1.4bn ringgit
                    (£280m/US$470m) to take the airline private. Its
                    closing price on Thursday was 24 sen.</p>

                  <p>Khazanah said a “complete overhaul” of the
                    airline would be carried out.</p>

                  <p>The business outlook for the Malaysian flagship
                    carrier deteriorated after one of its aircraft,
                    flight MH370, disappeared on 8 March. The
                    airline’s problems deepened on 17 July when
                    another jet, flight MH17, was shot down over
                    Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.</p>

                  <p>The disastrous run sped up efforts for the
                    government to restructure the airline, sources said
                    – even before two almost unfathomable crashes the
                    carrier’s financial performance was among the
                    worst in the industry.</p>

                  <p>A delisting paves the way for Khazanah, which is
                    chaired by the Malaysian prime minister, Najib
                    Razak, to revive the loss-making carrier, possibly
                    by selling off its profitable engineering, airport
                    services or budget airline units, trimming its
                    payroll and installing a new management team.</p>

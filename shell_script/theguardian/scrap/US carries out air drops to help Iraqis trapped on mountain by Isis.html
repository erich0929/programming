              <p>US military aircraft have dropped food and water for
                thousands of besieged Iraqis trapped by the the
                Islamist militant group <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title="More from the Guardian on Isis">Isis</a>, Barack
                Obama has confirmed, with the president also
                authorising air strikes against the insurgents if they
                advancde towards US forces.</p>

              <p>The delivery of relief took place after a day of
                intense debate at the White House over how to respond
                to an Isis army that has caused mass civilian
                displacement as it moves closer to previously stable
                Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>

              <p>"We need to act, and act now … today, America is
                coming to help," <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/obama-authorises-iraq-air-strikes-against-isis">the
                US president said</a> after officials announced the
                drop.</p>

              <p>The air drop was the first non-supply,
                non-surveillance and non-transport mission the US has
                flown over <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq" title="More from the Guardian on Iraq">Iraq</a> since
                the 2011 troop withdrawal. The Obama administration
                ordered the aid mission to help besieged religious
                minorities chased up a mountain by militants.</p>

              <p>Qaraqosh, Iraq's largest Christian city, was left all
                but abandoned as the jihadist group Islamic State
                (Isis) advanced through minority communities in the
                country's north-west and towards the Kurdish stronghold
                of Irbil. Late on Thursday night the UN security
                council condemned the attacks and urged international
                support for the Iraqi government.</p>

              <p>The US military is already helping the Iraqi
                government co-ordinate air drops of vital supplies to
                at least 40,000 Iraqis, mostly from the Yazidi
                minority, trapped on top of Mount Sinjar in the north
                after death threats from the Islamists who have overrun
                much of Sunni and northern Iraq.</p>

              <p>On Thursday, Pentagon officials at first repeatedly
                and categorically denied numerous reports claiming US
                air strikes or aid drops had begun, while internally
                the Obama administration urgently debated providing
                direct humanitarian air drops for Yazidis suffering
                without food or water, and even air strikes – a
                fateful step that Obama has been reluctant to take
                during the rise of Isis.</p>

              <p>"We have been working urgently and directly with
                officials in Baghdad and Irbil to co-ordinate Iraqi
                airdrops to people in need," a US defence official said
                on condition of anonymity.</p>

              <p>The official said the US was in constant co-ordination
                with the Iraqi government on "how we can help
                co-ordinate additional relief, enhance their efforts
                and provide direct assistance wherever possible."</p>

              <p>The air drop and potential strikes represent the first
                aerial campaign over Iraq since 2011 for a purpose
                beyond conducting surveillance on Isis, providing
                long-scheduled military sales or transporting the extra
                hundreds of US special operations "advisers" that Obama
                ordered into Iraq to help Baghdad confront the
                insurgency.</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="Iraq airStrikes2               WEB" height="762" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/8/1407485663065/IraqairStrikes2WEB.png" width="460"/> </span>
              <p>At the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest said
                the Yazidi case, as well as the mass internal
                displacement of Iraqi Christians, represented an
                "urgent humanitarian situation". He noted that Obama
                launched an air war against Libya's Muammar Gaddafi in
                2011 to forestall a bloodbath.</p>

              <p>"There are times where the president has taken
                military action, sometimes in consultation with our
                allies, to protect innocent, vulnerable civilian
                populations from slaughter or other dire humanitarian
                situations," Earnest said.</p>

              <p>Earnest reiterated a central contention Obama has
                often made about the root causes of Iraq's latest
                crisis – one that tacitly hinges lethal aid, which
                has been requested by the Iraqi government, on major
                Iraqi political reforms. "There are no [US] military
                solutions to the very difficult problems that exist in
                Iraq," Earnest said. "The failure of Iraq's political
                situation early on is what led to this situation."</p>

              <p>Obama's national security team considers that a
                guidepost for avoiding a return to a bloody
                entanglement in Iraq and recognising the limits of US
                power. His critics, and some foreign allies, consider
                it a signal of inaction.</p>

              <p>Over the past several weeks hundreds of American
                "advisers" – mostly elite military forces – have
                established joint operations centres in Baghdad and in
                the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. Those operations
                centres host US forces capable of spotting for
                potential air strikes.</p>

              <p>One option for US air missions is to launch from
                Incirlik air base, which the Americans share with the
                Turks and Britain's RAF, just outside the city of Adana
                on Turkey's southern Mediterranean coastline.</p>

              <p>It was a vital hub in both Afghan and Iraq wars,
                particularly for military air cargo. Its 10,000 ft main
                runway can accommodate giant C17 air transport planes,
                which can easily cover the 435 miles to the stranded
                Yazidi population on Mount Sinjar. Ankara announced
                earlier in the day that Turkish food parcels had been
                air-dropped for the Yazidis by Iraqi helicopters.</p>

              <p>The base was important strategically during the Cold
                War because of its close proximity to the Soviet Union.
                As a hangover from those days it still houses some of
                the few US nuclear weapons left in Europe, B61 gravity
                bombs, in hardened shelters on the base.</p>

              <p>UN officials say an estimated 200,000 new refugees are
                seeking sanctuary in the Kurdish north from Islamic
                extremists who have pursued them since the weekend.
                Qaraqosh, south-east of Mosul and home to around 50,000
                Christians, was the latest to fall, with most residents
                fleeing before dawn on Thursday as convoys of
                extremists drew near.</p>

              <p>Other Christian towns near Mosul, including Tel Askof,
                Tel Keif and Qaramless, have also largely been emptied.
                Those who remained behind were reportedly given the
                same stark choice given to other minorities, including
                Yazidis: flee, convert to Islam or be killed.</p>

              to video: US military action in Iraq would be 'limited'
              with no boots on the ground, says White House</a> </span>
              
              <p>Christians, Yazidis and Turkmen have been at the
                frontline of Iraq's war with Isis ever since the
                jihadist group stormed into Mosul and Tikrit in
                mid-June. The Iraqi army capitulated within hours, with
                at least 60,000 officers and soldiers fleeing on the
                first day of the assault alone.</p>

              <p>Ever since, the jihadists have continued to make
                advances, while Iraqi troops have concentrated on
                defending Baghdad and the Shia south, leaving the
                defence of minorities in the north to the Kurdish
                peshmurga.</p>

              <p>However, even the much vaunted Kurdish forces were no
                match for the heavy weapons wielded by the jihadists as
                they advanced in recent days. Peshmurga officers
                ordered troops to withdraw to areas administered by the
                Kurdish regional government – a clear sign of
                priorities and of where the battle lines are being
                drawn.</p>

              <p>Without any protection, Yazidis, Christians and
                Turkmen are being uprooted from communities they have
                lived in for millennia and the geo-social fabric of
                Iraq is being rapidly shredded.</p>

              <p>While those who have managed to flee the Christian
                areas have so far had a relatively safe passage to
                Irbil, the tens of thousands of Yazidis remain besieged
                near Sinjar, with little food or water. The UN said it
                was able to get some supplies overland to the stranded
                hordes – avoiding Isis fighters who have surrounded
                most of Mount Sinjar. Turkish foreign minister Ahmet
                Davutoglu announced that Turkish helicopters had
                dropped food and water on the mountain top. Iraqi
                helicopters have also made food drops, but stranded
                Yazidis say they do not have enough to survive.</p>

              <p>The Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk, Joseph Thomas,
                described the situation in northern Iraq as
                "catastrophic, a crisis beyond imagination". He
                demanded urgent intervention to save what remained of
                the area's Christian heritage.</p>

              <p>Kurdish officials on Thursday demanded more help in
                catering for refugees. The Kurdish administered areas
                have seen staggering numbers cross their notional
                border since the original Isis onslaught two months
                ago. In the first week alone, some 500,000 people are
                thought to have fled towards Irbil.</p>

              <p>The capital of the Kurdish north is already home to a
                new Chaldean Christian community, which fled Baghdad in
                the wake of an Isis-led massacre inside a cathedral in
                October 2010. Many fleeing Christians have headed for
                the Ainkawa neighbourhood, which is home to Baghdad's
                Christian exiles.</p>

              <p>The past 11 years of war and insurrection since the US
                invasion have led to most of Iraq's Christians fleeing.
                Numbers have plummeted starkly from an estimated one
                million before 2003 to around 150,000 now. A large
                number of those who remain are now displaced.</p>

              <p>Miriam Dagher, 53, from Qaraqosh, said churches in the
                city had already been torched and religious insignia
                smashed. "We stayed as long as we could," she said.
                "But nothing could save us. This is the end of our
                community."</p>

              <p>Isis has threatened to redraw the unitary borders that
                were carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. The
                group's rampant insurgency and the inability of state
                actors to stop it has rendered the frontier between
                Iraq and Syria evermore irrelevant.</p>

              <p>In the absence of central government authority, Shia
                militias are taking dominant roles, amplifying
                sectarian enmity between Islam's two most dominant
                sects.</p>

              <p>Iraq's beleaguered prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, no
                longer has the authority to unite the country's
                disparate sects. Maliki, a Shia Muslim, had
                disenfranchised much of the country's Sunni community
                over the past three years, some of whom have turned to
                Isis as a means of reasserting themselves.</p>

              <p>After digging in for the past two months, Maliki now
                faces a desperate battle to form a government, with his
                key backer Iran understood to have told him that it no
                longer supports his bid to lead the country for a third
                term.</p>

              <p>Massoud Barazani, a Kurdish leader, has said he is
                moving towards holding a referendum that could pave the
                way for an independence bid, a move that could spell
                the end of Iraq, and unsettle surrounding countries,
                including Syria, Turkey and Iran.</p>

              <p>The UN security council warned that the Isis attacks
                could constitute crimes against humanity and that those
                responsible should be held accountable. "The members of
                the security council also urge all parties to stop
                human rights violations and abuses and ensure
                humanitarian access and facilitate the delivery of
                assistance to those fleeing the violence," said
                Britain's UN ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, reading from
                a statement after an emergency consultation requested
                by France.</p>

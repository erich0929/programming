              <p>West African patients infected with the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="More from the Guardian on Ebola">Ebola</a> virus
                will not have access to experimental <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/drugs" title="More from the Guardian on Drugs">drugs</a> being
                used to treat American cases of the disease for several
                months, if at all, Nigerian health authorities said on
                Thursday.</p>

              <p>Health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu told a press
                conference he had asked the US health authorities about
                the unproven medicines used on two American doctors,
                but was told such small quantities existed that west <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" title="More from the Guardian on Africa">Africa</a>
                would have to wait for months for supplies, even if
                they were proved safe and effective.</p>

              <p>Dr Kent Brantly and Dr Nancy Writebol of the
                evangelical Christian organisation Samantha's Purse
                contracted the virus while helping to treat victims in
                Liberia. They were given the drug ZMapp after being
                evacuated to the US, and appear to be recovering.</p>

              <p>A spokesman for the US Centres for Disease Control
                said "there are virtually no doses available" and they
                would take several months to manufacture.</p>

              <p>Even if supplies do become available, medical
                ethicists are divided over whether they should be used
                in the current Ebola outbreak in west Africa. The World
                Health Organisation (WHO) has called a meeting of
                experts next week to help it guide doctors and drug
                companies who may consider shipping experimental drugs
                to the four countries hit by the disease.</p>

              <p>"We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak. We
                have a disease with a high fatality rate, without any
                proven treatment or vaccine," said Dr Marie-Paule
                Kieny, assistant director general at the WHO. "We need
                to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on
                what the responsible thing to do is."</p>

              <p>Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust,
                welcomed the meeting, saying there were critical
                ethical questions to consider.</p>

              <p>He called for the rapid establishment of "rigorous
                protocols for the study of experimental interventions",
                so that African countries could have the same
                opportunities to consider them as western ones and to
                ensure there would be equitable access to any treatment
                that worked.</p>

              <p>Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at
                Nottingham University, said there were many questions.</p>

              <p>"Giving unlicensed and untested (at least in humans)
                treatments and vaccines is a very thorny ethical
                issue," he said. "The infected US healthcare workers
                are receiving a type of treatment (antibodies that
                specifically target the virus) that has a reasonably
                long safety track record, so it isn't surprising –
                given the high fatality rate in the current outbreak
                – that they are happy to receive the therapy.</p>

              <p>"But not all drugs are safe – that's why we have
                very stringent clinical trials. One could argue that
                the current outbreak provides a perfect arena in which
                to test new drugs, but that isn't without risk. We
                don't know their safety, we don't know if they are
                likely to work – sure, they have been tested in
                animals, but these studies don't always tell us what
                will happen in humans."</p>

              <p>Some of the new treatments have not been tried with
                human at all, said Prof Tom Solomon, director of the
                NIHR health protection research unit in emerging and
                zoonotic infections. It is usual for drugs to be tried
                in healthy volunteers first, in case of side-effects.
                "The difference here is the desire for this 'first in
                man' experiment to be for a patient with the disease,"
                he said.</p>

              <p>"What is key is that if these new experimental drugs
                are going to be used, then this should only be done in
                the context of a clinical trial. Otherwise the worry is
                that we will have tried these drugs, including putting
                people through the potential risk of experimental
                treatments, and still be none the wiser about which are
                effective."</p>

              <p>Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the
                University of East Anglia, said most doctors in a
                situation like that of west Africa would want to try a
                drug that might work.</p>

              <p>"In my view, the ethical case is unequivocal. If a
                patient is likely to die and an experimental therapy
                has a reasonable chance to prevent death, then it
                should be given. However, this does not mean that any
                old drug could be given. For an experimental compound
                to be given, there should be good prior evidence that
                the therapy will work, the patient or his relatives
                should give informed consent wherever possible and
                whenever the therapy is given proper records must be
                kept and the outcome reported to WHO," he said.</p>

              <p>Unicef, meanwhile, warned that children who had been
                orphaned by Ebola were finding themselves shunned by
                their communities. "Children who are orphaned by the
                disease are finding it hard to be accepted in their
                communities and this has had huge psychological impacts
                on their lives," said the Unicef representative in
                Sierra Leone, Roeland Monasch.</p>

              <p>"The Ebola outbreak has led to widespread
                misconceptions and myths and these are posing serious
                challenges in the fight to eradicate it."</p>

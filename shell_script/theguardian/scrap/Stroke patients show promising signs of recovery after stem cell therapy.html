              <p>Stroke patients who took part in a small pilot study
                of a stem cell therapy have shown tentative signs of
                recovery six months after receiving the treatment.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Doctors said the condition of all five patients had
                improved after the therapy, but that larger trials were
                needed to confirm whether the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/stem-cells" title="More from the Guardian on Stem cells">stem
                cells</a> played any part in their progress. Scans of
                the patients' brains found that damage caused by the
                stroke had reduced over time, but similar improvements
                are often seen in stroke patients as part of the normal
                recovery process.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>At a six-month check-up, all of the patients fared
                better on standard measures of disability and
                impairment caused by stroke, but again their
                improvement may have happened with standard hospital
                care. The pilot study was designed to assess only the
                safety of the experimental therapy and with so few
                patients and no control group to compare them with, it
                is impossible to draw conclusions about the
                effectiveness of the treatment.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/AP/faces/pages/read/Home.jsp?person=p.bentley&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hs1ww5ae3_3&amp;_afrRedirect=103639001815235" title="">Paul Bentley</a>, a consultant neurologist at
                Imperial College London, said his group was applying
                for funding to run a more powerful randomised
                controlled trial on the therapy, which could see around
                50 patients treated next year.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"The improvements we saw in these patients are very
                encouraging, but it's too early to draw definitive
                conclusions about the effectiveness of the therapy,"
                said <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soma_Banerjee2" title="">Soma Banerjee</a>, a lead author and
                consultant in stroke medicine at Imperial College
                Healthcare NHS Trust. "We need to do more tests to work
                out the best dose and timescale for treatment before
                starting larger trials."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>The five patients in the pilot study were treated
                within seven days of suffering a severe stroke. Each
                had a bone marrow sample taken, from which the
                scientists extracted stem cells that give rise to blood
                cells and blood vessel lining cells. These stem cells
                were infused into an artery that supplied blood to the
                brain.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>The stem cells, called CD34+ cells, do not grow into
                fresh brain tissue, but might work by releasing
                chemicals that may dampen down inflammation and help
                other cells to grow where brain tissue is damaged. Some
                of the cells might also grow into new blood vessels,
                Bentley said.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Four out of five of the patients had the most serious
                type of stroke. Normally only 4% of these patients
                survive and are able to live independently after six
                months. In the pilot study, published in <a href="http://stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org/content/early/2014/08/07/sctm.2013-0178.abstract" title="">Stem Cells Translational Medicine</a>, all
                four were alive and three were independent six months
                later.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"Although they mention some improvement of some of the
                patients, this could be just chance, or wishful
                thinking, or due to the special care these patients may
                have received simply because they were in a trial,"
                said <a href="http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/research/robin-lovell-badge/" title="">Robin Lovell-Badge</a>, head of developmental
                genetics at the MRC's National Institute for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/medical-research" title="More from the Guardian on Medical                 research">Medical Research</a> in London.</p>

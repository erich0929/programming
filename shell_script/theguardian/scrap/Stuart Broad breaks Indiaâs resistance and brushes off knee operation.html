                  Broad on England’s dominant first day against India
                  – video</a></figcaption> </figure>
                  <p>Stuart Broad illustrated why England have delayed
                    his knee operation until at least the end of the
                    Test series against India with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/07/england-india-fourth-test-day-one-match-report">a
                    six-wicket performance at Old Trafford</a> – then
                    insisted there is no threat to his fitness for next
                    year’s World Cup.</p>

                  <p>“I could have had an operation at any stage in
                    the past 18 months,” said Broad, who will see a
                    Swedish specialist after the fifth Test at The Oval
                    to discuss whether to have surgery immediately or
                    wait until after the one-day series against India
                    that follows.</p>

                  <p>He will definitely miss the seven-match one-day
                    tour of Sri Lanka in November and December but
                    insisted there is no threat to his availability for
                    the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which
                    starts next February.</p>

                  <p>“It’s three-and-a-half months’ recovery, I
                    think, so I should be fine for that,” he said.
                    “It’s a good opportunity to get the knee sorted
                    and use it as a strength-and-conditioning period
                    – the 2015 schedule has just been released and it
                    looks pretty busy.”</p>

                  <p>Broad’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2014/aug/07/england-v-india-fourth-test-day-one-live">figures
                    of six for 25</a> were his third best in Test
                    cricket but he revealed that he had wanted England
                    to bat first on a grey Manchester morning. “It
                    turned out to be a great toss to lose,” he said
                    after India were skittled for 152, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/aug/07/ms-dhoni-england-india-fourth-test-day-one">despite
                    a brave attempt by their captain MS Dhoni to
                    justify his decision to bat</a>. Dhoni defied
                    dehydration and a late blow to the arm to make 71
                    but six of his team-mates failed to score,
                    equalling the world record for the number of ducks
                    in a Test innings.</p>

                  <p>Varun Aaron, India’s fastest bowler who was
                    making his first Test appearance since November
                    2011, hit back with a couple of late wickets,
                    including Alastair Cook hooking to long leg, and
                    there was another failure for the captain’s
                    opening partner, Sam Robson. Ian Bell has 45 from
                    56 balls and England will resume on 113 for three,
                    only 39 behind, although the ramifications of the
                    remnants of Hurricane Bertha’s mooted arrival on
                    Sunday may leave them with a race against time to
                    take a 2-1 lead in the series before the fifth
                    Test.</p>

                  <p>“That was a brilliant day, we’re in an
                    extremely strong position,” said Broad, who took
                    extra satisfaction from overtaking his former
                    Nottinghamshire and England team-mate Graeme
                    Swann’s tally of 255 Test wickets to pull clear
                    in sixth place in England’s all-time list.</p>

                  <p>“To be honest, when we lost the toss I was quite
                    disappointed because I thought it would be quite a
                    big toss to win. We were going to bat first but we
                    got lucky with the overheads but it still took
                    skill to exploit that.”</p>

                  <p>Broad and his new-ball partner Jimmy Anderson took
                    two wickets each without conceding a run in the
                    space of 13 balls as India slumped to 8 for 4.</p>

                  <p>“It looked like every ball was nickable,”
                    Broad said. “We challenged the front foot of the
                    India batsmen, the ball swung nicely for us and we
                    took our catches. Jimmy’s got it on a string when
                    it’s swinging like that. He looks in a great
                    rhythm, he’s feeling fit and I think he’s
                    benefiting from the time he took off after
                    Australia last winter. It’s great for me to
                    overtake Swanny, I’ll definitely drop him a text
                    but all eyes are on Jimmy at the moment, in terms
                    of records.”</p>

                  <p>Anderson has 374 wickets, nine behind Ian
                    Botham’s England record. “That’s hugely
                    exciting. I want to be around when that happens,”
                    Broad said, “and hopefully see him be the first
                    to get to 400 as well.”</p>

                  <p>Ravichandran Ashwin, the off-spinner who scored 40
                    in a seventh-wicket stand of 66 with Dhoni to go a
                    fair way to justifying his first appearance of the
                    series, raised eyebrows when he appeared to suggest
                    that his captain’s regular returns to the
                    dressing room during his innings were because “he
                    drank too much last night”.</p>

                  <p>This came as quite a surprise 24 hours after Dhoni
                    had said in the same press conference room that he
                    never suffered hangovers because he does not drink
                    alcohol. It later emerged that Ashwin, who said he
                    had felt “like a spring chicken in a box” as a
                    result of his recall, meant the opposite – Dhoni
                    needed to rehydrate at regular intervals after
                    failing to drink enough water.</p>

                  <p>India are likely to find support from England for
                    their proposals to reform the International Cricket
                    Council code of conduct after Anderson’s
                    reprieve. Sanjay Patel, the secretary of the Board
                    of Control for Cricket in India, said: “As I see
                    it, the ICC code needs to be revamped.”</p>

                  <p>England privately agree, although their concerns
                    centre on the citing system whereby India could
                    determine the severity of the charges against
                    Anderson, and therefore its possible consequences,
                    whereas in most other sports the charges are graded
                    by the disciplinary authorities.</p>

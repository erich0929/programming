              <p>A zoo in the Black Sea peninsula of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea" title="More from the Guardian on Crimea">Crimea</a> has
                welcomed its latest arrival – a zebroid, or zonkey.
                Named Telegraph by keepers at the Taigan zoo park in
                southern Crimea, the foal's head and body are the solid
                brown of a donkey, while his legs have the
                characteristic black stripes of a zebra.</p>

              <p>Oleg Zubkov, director of the private zoo near
                Simferopol, said Telegraph was very popular with
                visitors. He said Telegraph's mother, a zebra, had not
                had a mate for a long time and had been lonely and
                uncomfortable in her enclosure. "So on the advice of a
                zoologist we moved her in with several other hooved <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animals" title="More from the Guardian on Animals">animals</a>
                and she really liked the donkey. As a result of their
                affection for one another we've gotten Telegraph."</p>

              <p>Cross-breeding between zebras and other members of the
                equine family is not unheard of, although it is rare
                that the zebra is the mother. The breeding of zonkeys
                or other hybrids is normally frowned upon by the zoo
                community.</p>

              <p>"Such things don't happen in civilised zoos, but can
                occur at private zoos or on farms," said Anna
                Kachurovskaya, a spokeswoman for Moscow zoo. "This sort
                of marketing is not justified or scientific … zoos
                are for preserving wild species, that is one of their
                most important goals."</p>

              <p>Telegraph was named after a local newspaper that
                recently celebrated its fifth anniversary.</p>

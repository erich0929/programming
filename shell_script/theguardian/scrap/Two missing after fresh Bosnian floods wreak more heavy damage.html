              <p>Police in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bosnia-and-herzegovina" title="More from the Guardian on                 Bosnia-Herzegovina">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> are
                searching for two people swept away during the second
                bout of torrential rainfall since May, when the Balkans
                were hit by the worst floods in more than a century.</p>

              <p>The body of a woman was recovered on Thursday from the
                muddy bank of a river in northwestern Bosnia, and two
                people were listed as missing, police said.</p>

              <p>The country suffered almost €2bn (£1.6bn) worth of
                damage to homes, infrastructure and industry in May,
                when heavy rains caused rivers to burst their banks,
                sweep away roads and bridges and set off hundreds of
                landslides. More than 20 people died in Bosnia and more
                than 60 in Serbia.</p>

              <p>There were similar scenes, on a lesser scale, this
                week in Bosnia and parts of Serbia, where a man drowned
                in his cellar on Tuesday.</p>

              <p>Residents in Zeljezno Polje, in the central part of
                the country, who lost their homes in May saw their
                village cut off again this week. Gathering in the
                nearby town of Zepce, they called on local authorities
                to give them land to build new houses, clean the river
                bed and repair roads and power supplies before winter.</p>

              <p>"I have lived in a tent in the woods since May,"
                villager Besim Tutnjic told Reuters by telephone from
                Zepce. "The tent is now gone; we've received no help
                from the authorities and we don't know what to do or
                where to go."</p>

              <p>Tutnjic and 16 other members of his extended family
                were among hundreds of angry villagers who blocked the
                main road linking the towns of Zenica and Zepce.</p>

              <p>Last month, international donors pledged more than
                €1.8bn to aid the recovery and rebuilding in Bosnia
                and Serbia.</p>

              <p>A lack of co-ordination between Bosnia's two
                autonomous regions, created as a weak and dysfunctional
                union after the country's 1992-95 war, means none of
                the money allocated to Bosnia has yet been put to use.
                Donors say they will fund projects, which have still to
                be agreed on by the rival entities.</p>

              <p>"The money has been promised; where is the money?"
                said Tutnjic, who said he spent the night in a chair in
                front of the Zepce municipal building. "The government
                has made promises and done nothing, while we live in
                fear of rain each day."</p>

              <p>The government of the mainly Bosniak and Croat
                Federation, which together with the Serb Republic makes
                up Bosnia, declared a state of emergency on Thursday
                and allocated urgent funding for the worst hit areas.</p>

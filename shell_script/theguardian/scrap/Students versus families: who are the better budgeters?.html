              <p>Good news, <a href="http://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-results.html" title="">Save the Student</a> have done their annual
                student spending survey and discovered that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/students" title="More from the Guardian on Students">students</a>
                are getting better at economising. They've toned down
                their average monthly spend to £735 (from £768 per
                month last year) – a 4.2% reduction.</p>

              <p>Granted, it isn't a huge difference. But it the
                context of rising rent and travel costs, students have
                done well to bag a net saving by cutting back on
                clothes, bills and socialising.</p>

              <p>The most impressive reduction is a £38 a month trim
                in food spending. Either students have finally given up
                on ready-meals and learned to cook, or there is a long
                running multi-buy on Super Noodles happening at Tesco.</p>

              <p>So signs point to some impressively austere studying.
                But before we give the student population a pat on the
                back, we had better check how their spending compares
                to that of normal humans.</p>

              <p>Are students better with their budgets than families?
                And when parents nag about money (or as they would put
                it - "give budgeting advice") is it based on any real
                wisdom? Or are they just talking a good game on the
                phone from Waitrose, while stocking up on pre-made
                dauphinoise potato?</p>

              <p>There's only one way to find out – by
                cross-referencing the Save the Student figures with the
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/dec/11/families-spend-489-each-week-on-what" title="">Office of National Statistics data </a>for
                average household spending (well, what else was I going
                to do with my Saturday night?).</p>

              <p>By looking at five key areas of spending, we can see
                where the money is going, and crucially, who could be
                making more of a saving in each. Game on.</p>

              <h2>On-trend spends</h2>

              <p>Students are a fashion conscious bunch. Despite an £8
                decrease in their monthly spend, 14.3% of the average
                student budget still goes on clothes. I blame the
                students at St Martins and Goldsmiths for pushing up
                the averages with their trendy clobber. The average
                household spends just 4.8% of it's total on clothes –
                including 40p a week on men's underwear.</p>

              <p><strong>Winner: average household</strong></p>

              <h2>Home truths</h2>

              <p>The average household spends only 14% of it's monthly
                budget on rent and bills, yet due to the scandal that
                is student housing, university attendees are shelling
                out a whopping 57.5% of their budget on putting a roof
                over their heads. No wonder occupation protests are
                becoming so popular at universities - think of the
                savings.</p>

              <p><strong>Winner: average household</strong></p>

              <h2>On yer bike</h2>

              <p>Students are triumphing over families in the travel
                stakes, spending just 6% of their money on getting
                around - 5% less than the average household. This could
                be down to students undying commitment to stay green by
                cycling and walking wherever possible. Or it might be
                that all the tories in Wiltshire running three Land
                Rovers are distorting the figures.</p>

              <p><strong>Winner: students</strong></p>

              <h2>Credit crunching munching</h2>

              <p>Despite cutting their spending on food dramatically,
                students still spend a bigger portion of their reddies
                on food than Mr and Mrs Smith - 2.6% more, infact. I
                guess you can't put a price on good chili con carne.</p>

              <p><strong>Winner: average household</strong></p>

              <h2>Crap you don't need</h2>

              <p>Perhaps the most surprising result of all. The "Other"
                spend in the surveys (a polite way of saying
                "consumerist confetti", or "crap you don't need") is
                actually lower for students than the average household.
                Despite all those hours spent browsing Amazon when they
                should be studying, it seems students are sticking to
                the essentials rather than splashing out on 3D tellies
                and antique vases.</p>

              <p><strong>Winner: students</strong></p>

              <p><strong>FINAL VERDICT</strong></p>

              <p>Despite some clever cutbacks by student savers, they
                just can't compete with the economies of scale that
                come with family life. It's a victory for the (slightly
                less trendy) average households of Britain.</p>

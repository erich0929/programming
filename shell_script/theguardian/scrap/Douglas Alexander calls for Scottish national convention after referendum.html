              <p>The shadow foreign secretary, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/douglasalexander" title="More from the Guardian on Douglas                 Alexander">Douglas Alexander</a>, has revived his idea
                for a Scottish national convention after the referendum
                as a way of reconciling a divided <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scotland">Scotland</a>
                and mapping a new path for the country.</p>

              <p>With the polls showing no significant tightening in
                the wake of the first TV debate and the odds on a yes
                to independence vote on 18 September lengthening
                Alexander is keen to ensure there is a structure to a
                debate about Scotland's future if the SNP are defeated.</p>

              <p>All three unionist parties, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour" title="More from the Guardian on Labour">Labour</a>,
                the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats" title="More from the Guardian on Liberal                 Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives" title="More from the Guardian on                 Conservatives">Conservatives</a>, have called for a
                further <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/devolution" title="More from the Guardian on                 Devolution">devolution</a> of powers to Scotland,
                regardless of the outcome, and may want a mechanism to
                progress these ideas without circumventing the Scottish
                Assembly. The former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell
                has called for a meeting of all political parties
                within 30 days of a no vote.</p>

              <p>The former Scottish secretary, MP for Paisley, said:
                "After September 18th, Scotland will be divided by the
                outcome, with a significant minority feeling
                disappointed with personal feelings and hopes about
                themselves and their nation being dashed by the result.
                So I think all politicians in Scotland face an equal
                obligation to ensure that our nation comes together."</p>

              <p>He welcomed the Church of Scotland's proposal to hold
                a service of reconciliation in St Giles cathedral in
                Edinburgh on the Sunday after the vote. He said: "In
                the past, I've argued for the establishment of a
                national convention in the aftermath of a no vote. Its
                task would be, to chart a new vision for an old nation
                for the next decade.</p>

              <p>"I suggested that gathering 25 years on from the
                conclusion of the original constitutional convention, a
                national convention could look beyond an agenda of
                constitutional change, and address issues that had been
                crowded out in recent years by the debate over
                constitutional reform." He said such a convention could
                help the Scots write the next chapter of their national
                story.</p>

              <p>He admitted much of the debate so far had "too often
                been marked by rancour and bad temper. Scotland's
                future is at times is being debated in damaging terms
                which threatens to leave a lasting and bitter legacy".</p>

              <p>Alexander's remarks come as Ed Miliband returns to
                Scotland today to speak to business people about the
                dangers of separation and the failure of the SNP to set
                out an answer to the question of a Scottish currency,
                the issue that caused <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond" title="More from the Guardian on Alex Salmond">Alex
                Salmond</a> most difficulty in the Scottish TV debates.</p>

              <p>The all party Commons business select committee is due
                to deliver its verdict on the impact of separation on
                Scottish business in a report due out on Friday
                morning.</p>

              <p>If there is a substantial no vote, figures like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling" title="More from the Guardian on Alistair                 Darling">Alistair Darling</a> are eager to put the
                issue of separation to bed for the foreseeable future
                and prevent what has been described as an "ever-endum".</p>

              <p>But it is also possible nationalists will try to own a
                defeat by claiming the outcome is in effect "devo max",
                the proposition that did not get onto the ballot paper
                against the wishes of Salmond.</p>

              <p>Alexander argued: "The task between now and September
                18th is bringing home the vote, the task after the
                referendum is bringing Scotland together.</p>

              <p>"If Scotland votes no, then it will be a painful
                reckoning for the SNP… the settled will of the
                Nationalists will have run straight into the sovereign
                will of the Scottish people.</p>

              <p>"At that point, the Nationalists will face a choice:
                do they try and prove devolution wrong, or do they try
                and make devolution work?"</p>

              <p>He claimed the terms of the post referendum debate
                have now changed. "The nationalists wanted to argue
                that a no vote meant no change. But in recent months,
                with all of the main UK parties now offering
                significant additional powers for the Scottish
                Parliament, the terms of the referendum debate have
                shifted decisively, and the ground has given way under
                the nationalists.</p>

              <p>"More and more Scots now recognise that the referendum
                is not just a choice between change and the status quo.
                It is a choice between severing the British connection
                with a yes vote, or getting the best of both worlds
                with a no vote – more decisions taken here in
                Scotland backed up by the strength, stability, and
                security of the UK."</p>

              <p>Ironically, Labour was pressed by the independent
                think tank Reform Scotland this week to catch up with
                the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives by
                strengthening its devolution proposals. Both the
                Liberal Democrat and Conservative commissions
                recommended the devolution of the entirety of income
                tax, which would lead to the Scottish parliament
                raising around 40% of what it spends.</p>

              <p>Reform Scotland said in contrast Labour proposed only
                "tinkering" with the Scotland Act 2012, increasing the
                amount of income tax raised in Scotland from 10p to
                15p. Reform Scotland chairman Ben Thomson said: "The
                Labour devolution commission's interim report was
                genuinely radical, but its final report was a damp
                squib."</p>

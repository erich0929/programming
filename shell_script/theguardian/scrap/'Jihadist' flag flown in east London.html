              <p>A black flag with white Arabic writing, similar to
                those flown by jihadist groups, was flying at the
                entrance of an east <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london" title="More                 from the Guardian on London">London</a> housing state
                near Canary Wharf.</p>

              <p>In a highly provocative gesture, the emblem was
                planted on top of the gates of the Will Crooks estate
                on Poplar High Street, and is surrounded by flags of
                Palestine and slogans.</p>
              <span class="inline"> <img alt="The jihadi flag outside               the Poplar estate showing the Arabic script" data-pin-description="The Arabic script on the flag " height="295" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407441886856/The-jihadi-flag-outside-t-001.jpg" width="208"/> <span class="caption" style="width:               208px;"> The Arabic script on the flag </span> </span>
              <p>The flag bears similar writing to the jihadi flags
                that have been flown by the extremist group in Iraq and
                other jihadi groups since the 1990s. When the estate
                was approached last night, a group of about 20 Asian
                youths swore at Guardian journalists and told them to
                leave the area immediately. One youth threatened to
                smash a camera.</p>

              <p>When a passerby tried to take a picture of the flag on
                a phone, one of the gang asked him if he was Jewish.
                The passerby replied: "Would it make a difference?" The
                youth said: "Yes, it fucking would." Asked if the flag
                was an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title="More from the Guardian on Isis">Isis</a> flag,
                one local man said: "It is just the flag of Allah." But
                another man asked: "So what if it is?"</p>

              <p>One local man said that the flag has been there for
                several days. "People were taking photos of it last
                night," he said. A Metropolitan police spokesman said
                on Thursday that they had received no complaints about
                offensive flags in the Tower Hamlets area. The Dutch
                government has banned the public display of the Isis
                flag, but it is not illegal in the UK.</p>

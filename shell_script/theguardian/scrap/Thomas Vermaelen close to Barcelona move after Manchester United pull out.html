                  <p>Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is close to a
                    £15m move to Barcelona after a proposed switch to
                    Manchester United broke down.</p>

                  <p>The Belgium defender could complete a move to the
                    Camp Nou over the weekend. United wanted to sign
                    the defender but ended their interest on Friday
                    after Louis van Gaal refused to include a player in
                    exchange.</p>

                  <p>The new United manager had considered the Belgium
                    centre-back to be a candidate to fill the
                    left-sided position in the back three of the 3-5-2
                    system he is aiming to implement at Old Trafford
                    this season.</p>

                  <p>However, Arsène Wenger has steadfastly refused to
                    sell to their rivals unless a swap deal could be
                    agreed and Van Gaal is not prepared to consider
                    that.</p>

                  <p>On Thursday <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/07/arsene-wenger-hints-manchester-united-want-sign-thomas-vermaelen-arsenal">Wenger
                    all but admitted United were one of the clubs
                    interested in the defender</a> and refused to
                    discuss the size of the bids received but confirmed
                    Arsenal have received offers for the Belgian.</p>

                  <p>“Have we received bids? Yes. I can’t tell you
                    who from but you will know very soon,” Wenger
                    said. “Are Man United one of the teams to have
                    made an offer? I think they could be in the
                    group.”</p>

                  <p>Vermaelen, who arrived from Ajax in 2009, made 21
                    appearances for Arsenal last season. Niggling
                    injuries and the form of Laurent Koscielny and Per
                    Mertesacker limited his impact. However, despite
                    being an unused substitute at Wembley, he did <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/17/fa-cup-final-arsenal-hull-city-report">lift
                    the FA Cup in May</a> as Arsenal ended their
                    nine-year trophy drought.</p>

                  <p>The 28-year-old has made 150 appearances in all
                    competitions, scoring 15 goals for the London club.</p>

              emergency', says WHO</a> </span>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organisation" title="More from the Guardian on World Health                 Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> has
                declared the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="More from the Guardian on Ebola">Ebola</a>
                outbreak an international public health emergency, but
                it is not recommending general bans on travel or trade.</p>

              <p>The global body said the Ebola outbreak – the
                largest and longest in history – was happening in
                countries without the resources to manage the
                infections, some with devastated healthcare systems
                still recovering from war, and called on the
                international community to help.</p>

              <p>"Countries affected to date simply do not have the
                capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and
                complexity on their own," said Margaret Chan, the WHO's
                director general. "I urge the international community
                to provide this support on the most urgent basis
                possible."</p>

              <p>The current outbreak began in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea" title="More from the Guardian on Guinea">Guinea</a> in
                March and has spread to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sierraleone" title="More from the Guardian on Sierra Leone">Sierra
                Leone</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/liberia" title="More from the Guardian on Liberia">Liberia</a>,
                with some cases in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria" title="More from the Guardian on Nigeria">Nigeria</a>.
                There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola and
                the death rate has been about 50%.</p>

              <p>The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days,
                meaning symptoms do not necessarily show before then.</p>

              <p>The WHO emergency committee unanimously agreed, after
                two days of meetings in Geneva and teleconferences with
                representatives in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and
                Nigeria, that the outbreak was "an extraordinary
                event", meeting all the conditions for a public health
                emergency, Chan said.</p>

              <p>With 1,711 confirmed and suspected cases, and 932
                deaths, the WHO said the outbreak was a public health
                risk to other states – particularly in view of
                "fragile health care systems" in the affected
                countries.</p>

              <p>Although the WHO said that "there should be no general
                ban on international travel or trade," it issued a long
                list of recommendations on travel and contacts,
                including urging that all travellers leaving the
                countries affected by the outbreak should be screened
                for fever, and that no corpses should be transported
                across borders.</p>

              <p>It said other states should provide information to
                people travelling to affected and at risk areas, be
                prepared to detect, investigate and manage Ebola cases,
                and be prepared for the evacuation and repatriation of
                nationals, including health workers.</p>

              <p>States should also ensure access to specialist
                diagnostic laboratories, and prepare to manage
                travellers who arrive at international airports or
                border crossings with "unexplained febrile illness".</p>

              <p>"The possible consequences of further international
                spread are particularly serious in view of the
                virulence of the virus, the intensive community and
                health facility transmission patterns, and the weak
                health systems in the currently affected and most
                at-risk countries," a statement said. "A coordinated
                international response is deemed essential to stop and
                reverse the international spread of Ebola."</p>

              <p>The charity Save the Children, which said it was
                scaling up its operations in the region, warned that
                medical services in the affected countries were already
                overwhelmed. Rob MacGillivray, its regional
                humanitarian director, said that even before the
                outbreak there was less than one doctor for every
                33,000 people in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>

              <p>"Parents are understandably frightened and stay away
                from medical centres through fear of coming into
                contact with the infection. Pregnant mothers are giving
                birth at home rather than seeking skilled help and
                orphaned children are at risk of being ostracised from
                their communities at the most vulnerable time in their
                lives.</p>

              <p>"Challenges remain in reaching families in rural
                communities who were struggling to access healthcare
                even before the outbreak."</p>

              <p>The WHO said health advice at airports and ports or
                border crossings should warn travellers that though the
                disease is rare, careful hygiene should be practised,
                and all contact with blood and body fluids of infected
                people or animals, or with any items that have come in
                contact with such blood or body fluids, must be
                avoided.</p>

              <p>It also says that sexual intercourse with a sick
                person or one recovering from Ebola should be avoided
                "for at least seven weeks".</p>

              <p>The WHO <a href="http://" title="">advises that the
                risk to travellers from sharing a flight with somebody
                who is showing symptoms of Ebola</a> is "very low" –
                but does recommend contacting fellow travellers if a
                sufferer reports their condition and seeks medical help
                on arrival.</p>

              <p>For those travelling to affected areas, the WHO
                describes the risk of business travellers or tourists
                returning with the virus as "extremely low" – even,
                it says, "if the visit included travel to the local
                areas from which primary cases have been reported".</p>

              <p>"Transmission requires direct contact with blood,
                secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected
                living or dead persons or animals, all unlikely
                exposures for the average traveller. Tourists are in
                any event advised to avoid all such contacts."</p>

              <p>It said the risk to travellers visiting friends and
                relatives in affected countries was similarly low
                "unless the traveller has direct physical contact with
                a sick or dead person or animal infected with Ebola
                virus".</p>

              <p>The long list of advice to affected states includes
                screening all travellers leaving for fever, banning the
                remains of those who have died of Ebola from being
                transported across borders, and ensuring "funerals and
                burials are conducted by well-trained personnel".</p>

              <p>Countries with land borders with the affected states
                are urged "urgently to establish surveillance for
                clusters of unexplained fever or deaths due to febrile
                illness", and to act within 24 hours of any suspected
                cases.</p>

              <p>The United States is sending teams of experts to
                Liberia, including 12 specialists from the US Centers
                for Disease Control and Prevention, after the Liberian
                president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, declared a 90-day
                state of emergency and said the disease had overwhelmed
                her country's healthcare system.</p>

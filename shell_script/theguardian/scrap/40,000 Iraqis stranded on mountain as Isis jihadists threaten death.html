              death from Isis jihadists</a> </span>
              <p>Tens of thousands of members of one of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq" title="More from the Guardian on Iraq">Iraq</a>'s
                oldest minorities have been stranded on a mountain in
                the country's north-west, facing slaughter at the hands
                of jihadists surrounding them below if they flee, or
                death by dehydration if they stay.</p>

              <p>UN groups say at least 40,000 members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazidi" title="">Yazidi sect</a>, many of them women and
                children, have taken refuge in nine locations on Mount
                Sinjar, a craggy, mile-high ridge identified in local
                legend as the final resting place of Noah's ark.</p>

              <p>At least 130,000 more people, many from the Yazidi
                stronghold of Sinjar, have fled to Dohuk, in the
                Kurdish north, or to Irbil, where regional authorities
                have been struggling since June to deal with one of the
                biggest and most rapid refugee movements in decades.</p>

              <p>Sinjar itself has been all but emptied of its 300,000
                residents since jihadists stormed the city late on
                Saturday, but an estimated 25,000 people remain. "We
                are being told to convert or to lose our heads," said
                Khuldoon Atyas, who has stayed behind to guard his
                family's crops. "There is no one coming to help."</p>

              <p>Another man, who is hiding in the mountains and
                identified himself as Nafi'ee, said: "Food is low,
                ammunition is low, and so is water. We have one piece
                of bread to share between 10 people. We have to walk
                2km to get water. There were some air strikes yesterday
                [against the jihadists], but they have made no
                difference."</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="Iraq isis WEB" height="511" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407340796120/IraqisisWEB.png" width="460"/> </span>
              <p>At least 500 Yazidis, including 40 children, have been
                killed in the past week, local officials say. Many more
                have received direct threats, either from the advancing
                militants or members of nearby Sunni communities allied
                with them. "They were our neighbours and now they are
                our killers," said Atyas.</p>

              <p>"It's not like this is a one-off incident," said the
                Unicef spokeswoman Juliette Touma. "We are almost back
                to square zero in terms of the preparedness and the
                supplies. Enormous numbers of people have been crossing
                the border since June.</p>

              <p>"The stresses are enormous; dehydration, fatigue,
                people sometimes having to walk for days. The impact on
                kids is very physical, let alone the psychological
                impact."</p>

              <p>The Kurdish minority Yazidis have long been regarded
                as devil worshippers by Sunni jihadists who have
                targeted them since the US invasion. As the extremists'
                latest and most potent incarnation, the Islamic State
                (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title="More from the Guardian on Isis">Isis</a>), has
                steadily conquered Iraq's north, the small,
                self-contained community has been especially
                vulnerable.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/syria-iraq-isis-rogue-state-along-two-rivers.html?_r=0" title="">Isis forces advanced</a> across north-western
                Iraq almost unchecked since a small band of hardliners
                stormed Iraq's second city, Mosul, on 10 June, sending
                the Iraqi army fleeing and shattering the central
                government's control.</p>

              <p>Flush with weapons looted from Iraqi arsenals, Isis
                sacked Tikrit and advanced on Kirkuk. With new recruits
                lured or pressganged along the way, it has captured
                five oilfields and three cities, an 800-mile stretch of
                border with Syria. It has menaced Baghdad and is now
                within striking distance of Iraq's two largest dams.</p>

              <p>"The situation is slowly tipping in their favour,"
                said Dr Hisham al-Hashimi, Iraq's leading expert on
                Isis. "They won't take the dam near Mosul, but Haditha
                [at the centre of Iraq's water and energy supply grid]
                will be very hard to defend.</p>

              <p>"They are very close to Baghdad airport. If they
                breached the perimeter, even with a symbolic attack, it
                would be enormous propaganda value for them."</p>

              <p>Iraq's beleaguered military has been unable to muster
                a meaningful push back against the jihadists and is
                under intense pressure to support the Yazidis with air
                strikes and food drops. A series of spectacular defeats
                has seriously eroded its credibility. Baghdad claimed
                on Wednesday that its military had carried out an air
                strike on a Mosul prison which killed scores of
                jihadists and freed an unknown number of prisoners. The
                area was impossible to access and the numbers of
                fatalities could not be verified. However, witnesses
                reported damage to the prison and relatives rushed to
                the gates in the hope of rescuing detained family
                members.</p>

              <p>Kurdish Peshmurga troops, long regarded as a more
                formidable fighting force, had been defending Sinjar,
                but they too were forced to withdraw as Isis advanced.
                Kurdish officials say their forces were seriously
                outgunned by the jihadists, who were using heavy
                weapons looted from Iraqi bases.</p>

              <p>The same weapons are being used to consolidate Isis's
                hold on much of western Iraq. The group has
                significantly boosted its numbers by tapping into
                Iraq's estranged Sunni population, which has been
                marginalised by the Shia majority government since the
                US overthrow of Saddam Hussein more than 11 years ago.</p>

              <p>"I would say there are now between 30,000 and 50,000
                of them," Hashimi said. "Of those, I would say 30% are
                ideologues. The others have joined out of fear or
                coercion."</p>

              <p>The once dominant US military and powerful embassy now
                play next to no role in Iraq, with Iraqi militias
                reporting to Iranian generals increasingly taking the
                lead in the fight against the jihadists.</p>

              <p>"Iraq is spiralling out of control," said Ali Khedery,
                the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. "The
                centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on
                one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond
                concerned."</p>

              <p>Khedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three
                US central command generals and is now chairman of the
                Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said:
                "Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is
                no credible international actor that I can see that is
                trying to bring it together again.</p>

              <p>"It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi
                government and I think it represents yet another
                manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know
                it.</p>

              <p>"Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri]
                al-Maliki's consolidation of power in a very sectarian
                way, have all led to the disillusionment, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/-sp-middle-east-politics-2014-egypt-syria-palestine-iraq-gaza" title="">disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs</a>, who
                have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to
                consummate a deal with the devil. Now we are locked in
                a race to the bottom."</p>

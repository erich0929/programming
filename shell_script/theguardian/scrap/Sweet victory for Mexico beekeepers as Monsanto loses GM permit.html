                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>A small group of beekeepers in Mexico has
                    inflicted a blow on biotech giant Monsanto, which
                    has halted the company’s ambitions to plant
                    thousands of hectares of soybeans genetically
                    modified to resist the company’s pesticide <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/frequently-asked-questions.aspx" title="">Roundup</a>.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>A district judge in the state of Yucatán last
                    month overturned a permit issued to Monsanto by
                    Mexico’s agriculture ministry, Sagarpa, and
                    environmental protection agency, Semarnat, in June
                    2012 that allowed commercial planting of <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/genuity-roundup-ready-2-yield-soybeans.aspx" title="">Roundup-ready soybeans</a>.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The permit authorised Monsanto to plant its seeds
                    in seven states, over more than 253,000 hectares
                    (625,000 acres), despite protests from thousands of
                    Mayan farmers and beekeepers, Greenpeace,
                    the&nbsp;Mexican&nbsp;National&nbsp;Commission for
                    the Knowledge&nbsp;and&nbsp;Use&nbsp;of
                    Biodiversity,&nbsp;the National Commission&nbsp;of
                    Natural Protected Areas&nbsp;and the National
                    Institute&nbsp;of Ecology.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>In withdrawing the permit, the judge was convinced
                    by the scientific evidence presented about the
                    threats posed by GM soy crops
                    to&nbsp;honey&nbsp;production&nbsp;in the Yucatán
                    peninsula, which includes Campeche,
                    Quintana&nbsp;Roo&nbsp;and Yucatán states.
                    Co-existence between honey production and GM
                    soybeans is not possible, the judge ruled.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Mexico is the world’s six biggest producer and
                    third largest exporter of honey. About 25,000
                    families on the Yucatán peninsula depend on honey
                    production. This tropical region produces about 40%
                    of the country’s honey, almost all of which is
                    exported to the EU. This is not small change: in
                    2011, <a href="http://www.fintrac.com/cpanelx_pu/Ethiopia%20CIAFS/12_06_4949_CIAFS%20_1%20Honey%20Final%20Oct%2011.pdf" title="">the EU imported $54m (£32m) worth of
                    Mexican honey</a>.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The concerns are multiple. Roundup-ready crops –
                    soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, cotton and
                    alfalfa – have been manipulated to be resistant
                    to glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/genetically-modified-foods-zm0z12amzmat.aspx?PageId=4#axzz39ZU1mkh2" title="">Some argue that</a> glyphosate <a href="http://web.mit.edu/demoscience/Monsanto/index.html" title="">poses a risk</a> to <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-roundup-the-impacts-of-glyphosate-herbicide-on-human-health-pathways-to-modern-diseases/5342520" title="">human and animal health</a>, a claim that
                    <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monsanto.com%2Fproducts%2Fdocuments%2Fglyphosate-background-materials%2Fgly_human_risk.pdf&amp;ei=ZkrjU-qmIKyu7Aaby4CgAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpBitMGYH2P1hYOGeunOIPxRZQhQ&amp;sig2=PMeoPDLTKa4dXlhG0fKtJg&amp;bvm=bv.72676100,d.ZGU&amp;cad=rja" title="">Monsanto</a> and other agribusinesses
                    reject.</p>

                  <p>In addition to health risks, <a href="http://permaculturenews.org/2012/11/01/why-glyphosate-should-be-banned-a-review-of-its-hazards-to-health-and-the-environment/" title="">environmental damage to soil, water</a>
                    and <a href="http://guardianlv.com/2014/05/bees-dying-at-an-alarming-rate-is-glyphosate-the-cause-video/" title="">bee colonies</a> – which are <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130510-honeybee-bee-science-european-union-pesticides-colony-collapse-epa-science/" title="">dwindling</a> fast – have been
                    attributed glyphosate use, threatening food and
                    water security across the globe.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>GM crops could devastate the important European
                    export market for Mexican beekeepers, where the
                    sale of honey containing pollen derived from GM
                    crops has been restricted since <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2011-09/cp110079en.pdf" title="">a landmark decision in 2011 by the
                    European court of justice</a>.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The ruling barred honey derived from a GM crop
                    unapproved for human consumption – which includes
                    some soy and other animal feeds – from sale in
                    the EU. Honey with more than 0.9% of GM pollen
                    (from an approved GM food) must be labelled as
                    containing GM ingredients and cannot be marketed as
                    an organic product. Some countries, including
                    Germany, reject honey that contains any GM pollen.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>A <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140207/srep04022/full/srep04022.htm" title="">small study conducted in Campeche</a>,
                    where about 10,000 hectares of GM soybeans were
                    planted after the permit was approved in 2012,
                    found GM pollen in some honey samples destined for
                    the European market. This, say the authors,
                    threatens the local honey industry and contradicts
                    the position taken by Sagarpa and industry groups
                    that soybeans are not visited or pollinated by bees
                    searching for food because they can self-pollinate.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The <a href="http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/07/23/opinion/002a1edi" title="">Monsanto ruling was commended</a> by the
                    respected national newspaper La Jornada, which
                    accused the Mexican government of ignoring
                    widespread concerns over GM and forcing those
                    opponents to fight it out in court with powerful
                    multinational companies. The government’s stated
                    ambition of eliminating hunger is incompatible with
                    its decisions to increasingly allow multinational
                    companies such as Monsanto to introduce GM crops,
                    the paper’s editorial concluded.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>Central to the ruling was the Mexican
                    constitution, specifically the government’s
                    obligation to fully consult indigenous communities
                    before making any major decision about what
                    happens, including what is grown, on their
                    territory. The judge ordered planting to stop and
                    gave Sagarpa six months to carry out full and
                    proper consultations with indigenous farmers –
                    which it should have done before the permit was
                    granted in 2012.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>It was this same omission that led to an <a href="http://m.greenpeace.org/international/en/high/news/Blogs/makingwaves/blow-against-monsanto-in-mexico/blog/48524/" title="">almost identical ruling by a district
                    judge in Campeche</a> in March 2014.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>These two judgments have set a precedent that will
                    help farmers, campaigners and environmentalists
                    take local legal action against the rollout of GM
                    soy and corn, which the federal government is
                    sanctioning without consultation and against
                    experts’ advice.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>But this is a high-stakes game to play, in which
                    indigenous communities are being forced to fight
                    their own government and multinational corporations
                    with multimillion-dollar legal departments, simply
                    to have their constitutional rights honoured and
                    protect their traditional ways of farming and
                    living.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>So while a third victory in Chiapas, where a
                    similar case is pending, could soon follow, this is
                    almost certainly only round one. Monsanto will
                    probably appeal against the decision to a higher
                    court.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>The <a href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/agnafta.html" title="">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>,
                    criticised by some for crippling small-scale
                    Mexican farming, is not on the side of the
                    beekeepers. This David and Goliath battle is about
                    so much more than honey.</p>

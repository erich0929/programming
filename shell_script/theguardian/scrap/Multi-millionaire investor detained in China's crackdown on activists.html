              <p>Chinese police have detained a multimillionaire
                investor in what <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights" title="More from the Guardian on Human rights">human
                rights</a> campaigners warn is a broadening crackdown
                on activists.</p>

              <p>Wang Gongquan was taken into custody by up to 20
                Beijing police officers on Friday on suspicion of
                "gathering a crowd to disrupt public order", according
                to supporters.</p>

              <p>His friend Xu Zhiyong, a well-known lawyer and leading
                member of a grassroots grouping supporting civil
                society, was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/china-lawyer-xu-zhiyong-arrested" title="">formally arrested on the same charge last
                month after weeks in detention</a>.</p>

              <p>"Wang was summoned at noon … it was because he has
                taken part in social activities, human rights
                activities with Xu Zhiyong," said lawyer Teng Biao.</p>

              <p>Human Rights Watch said earlier this week that 17
                members of the loosely organised New Citizens movement
                are among 55 people detained since spring for
                organising collective actions of various kinds,
                including protests. Sixteen of those have since been
                released, some on bail, but friends are increasingly
                concerned that others will be indicted, tried and
                jailed.</p>

              <p>Activists fear the moves are part of a broader
                tightening of the political environment by the new
                leadership under <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping" title="More from the Guardian on Xi Jinping">Xi
                Jinping</a>, including the curbing of online dissent.</p>

              <p>"There is no doubt that this is a step up in the
                suppression of critical voices in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china" title="More from the Guardian on China">China</a>,"
                said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior Asia researcher at
                Human Rights Watch.</p>

              <p>"You have a twin push in the real world and the
                virtual world. Anywhere you look at the moment − it's
                the same direction.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"Suddenly people who were somewhat tolerated before
                find themselves vulnerable − and all of this is
                happening while China is seeking a seat on the human
                rights council at the United Nations," Bequelin added,
                saying that the current push was more than a cyclical
                crackdown on dissent.</p>

              <p>Chinese scholars have also expressed concern about
                increased pressure on academics. Unusually, the
                state-run English news website China Daily <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-09/13/content_16968624.htm" title="">also reported on Wang's detention</a>,
                although it said police had taken him for "unknown
                reasons".</p>

              <p>In an <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1309146/i-am-afraid-no-more-says-billionaire-venture-capitalist-wang" title="">interview with the South China Morning
                Post</a> in July, Wang said: "In today's China people
                are getting arrested every day. It's impractical for
                one to claim that he has no fears. But I may not be as
                scared as many others, because I have been involved in
                such matters for years − meetings and discussions."</p>

              <p>The 51-year-old added: "For a long time I have been
                harshly criticising some problems in the government,
                including in the ruling party. Some have called my
                comments radical. I don't feel radical at all. I think
                some entrepreneurs fear too much."</p>

              <p>Some think Wang is being punished in part for <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/jailed-china-activist-citizens-seek-rights-094702837.html" title="">pressing for Xu's release</a> and releasing a
                video showing his friend, speaking inside jail, urging
                citizens to pursue their rights. Sui Muqing, a lawyer
                acting for Guo Feixiong − another detained rights
                advocate − suggested the government might be seeking
                to discourage business people from financially
                supporting activists.</p>

              <p>Guo was detained on the "gathering crowds" charge in
                mid-August but Sui's requests to meet his client have
                been rejected four times, the lawyer said.</p>

              <p>Backers have said that the New Citizens movement
                operates within the constitution, but its popularity
                appears to have roused the concern of authorities.
                Hundreds of supporters turned up to its informal
                dinners.</p>

              <p>Members also called on officials to publicly disclose
                their assets − a message clearly unwelcome to
                authorities despite the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/china-xi-succeeds-jiang-communist" title="">new leadership's pledge to root out
                corruption</a>.</p>

              <p>Liu Ping, an activist from Jiangxi who held a protest
                demanding such disclosure in April, has been indicted
                for illegal assembly, gathering a crowd to disrupt
                public order and using a cult to damage enforcement of
                the law, Human Rights in China reported last month.</p>

              <p>Wang, a venture capitalist, is one of a number of
                business people who have become increasingly bold in
                their calls for reform and criticism of the government.
                But authorities this week underlined their
                determination to rein in "big Vs" − verified users
                with large followings − by issuing a new judicial
                interpretation warning <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-rumours" title="">people may be charged with defamation</a> if
                they post rumours which are read by 5,000 users or
                forwarded more than 500 times.</p>

              <p>Microbloggers also voiced intense scepticism after
                Chinese-born American investor Xue Manzi, or Charles
                Xue, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/aug/30/charles-xue-prostitution-confession-broadcast-video" title="">was detained in Beijing last month on
                suspicion of soliciting prostitutes</a>. Many suspected
                the decision to parade him on television was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324906304579034473911600230.html" title="">intended to deter other prominent figures</a>
                from his brand of caustic commentary.</p>

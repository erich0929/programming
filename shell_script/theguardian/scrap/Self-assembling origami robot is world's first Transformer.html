              <p>Harvard scientists have built the world's first
                working Transformer robot, inspired by the ancient
                Japanese paper-folding art of origami.</p>

              <p>The alien <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/robots" title="More from the Guardian on Robots">robots</a>
                that feature in the Transformer movies conceal their
                true nature by taking on the form of cars and trucks.
                The scientists' robot has yet to reach that level of
                technical deception and disguises itself – for now,
                at least – as a robot that has been flattened.</p>

              <p>Footage from the researchers' laboratory shows a sheet
                of paper and plastic mounted with batteries and motors
                that folds itself into a working machine without human
                intervention and then scuttles out of shot.</p>

              <p>The flat-pack robot uses "shape memory polymers" that
                contract like muscles when they are heated. The robot
                takes about four minutes to assemble from scratch and
                can walk at a speed of around 5cm per second.</p>

              <p>"Getting a robot to assemble itself autonomously and
                actually perform a function has been a milestone we've
                been chasing for many years," said Rob Wood at the Wyss
                Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at
                Harvard.</p>

              to video: Origami robot builds itself</a> </span>
              <p>Built with help from researchers at MIT, the robot
                could pave the wave for flat-packed machines for use in
                space or in hazardous environments on Earth where they
                can be put into confined spaces and left to assemble
                themselves.</p>

              <p>"Imagine a ream of dozens of robotic satellites
                sandwiched together so that they could be sent up to
                space and then assemble themselves remotely once they
                get there. They could take images, collect data and
                more," said Sam Felton, who helped to make the machine.
                Details of the robot are revealed in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1252610" title="">Science</a>.</p>

              <p>The team used computer design tools to create the
                robot from a three-ply sheet. The first sheet is paper,
                the second a flexible electronic circuit, and the third
                the shape memory polymer. Hinges that allow the robot's
                legs to move into position are programmed to fold at
                specific angles. Each hinge contains tiny circuits that
                heat up on command to move the robot's limbs. To work
                out where the folds need to go, the scientists used
                software called Origamizer.</p>

              <p>Around four minutes after assembly, the robot's hinges
                cool down enough to set hard and the robot's
                microcontroller sends signals to the limbs to make it
                walk. Felton said that the equipment to make the
                13cm-long robot would cost about $3,000 at commercial
                rates with each robot costing around $100.</p>

              <p>The robot has a built-in timer and starts to fold
                itself into shape 10 seconds after its batteries have
                been fitted. "We could easily modify this such that the
                folding is triggered by an environmental sensor, such
                as temperature or pressure," Felton said. To fold
                itself into shape and scurry off consumed the energy
                stored in an AA battery.</p>

              <p>Daniela Rus, who worked on the project at MIT, said
                the technology could have a major impact on
                manufacturing processes. "This will rapidly extend the
                manufacturing capabilities that we have today where
                configuring an assembly line is done manually and
                requires a lot of time.</p>

              <p>"Our big dream is to really make the fabrication of
                robots fast and inexpensive," she added.</p>

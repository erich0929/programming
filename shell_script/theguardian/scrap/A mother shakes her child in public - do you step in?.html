                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>On a packed bus one recent Saturday, I watched an
                    ugly scene unfold. A mother shaking a boy aged
                    perhaps six or seven. Not super-hard, you
                    understand, but borderline rough. Then the boy
                    complained to his mother that she had punched him.</p>

                  <p>“That wasn’t a punch,” she said. “That was
                    a push.” To drive home the point, she pushed him,
                    right in the center of his chest. This,” – she
                    hit his arm – “is a punch. I suppose you’ll
                    go telling everyone that I’ve been hitting you
                    now?”</p>

                  <p>The boy sank to the floor of the bus and started
                    to cry. I stared disapprovingly at the woman but
                    she didn’t notice.</p>

                  <p>“Get up,” the mother said. If he didn’t, she
                    warned, she’d pull him up by his ear.</p>

                  <p>“Why are you so bad?” she kept on. “None of
                    my other children are bad like you are.”</p>

                  <p>He started to cry. For three bus-stops, I stood
                    there, like some strap-hanging Hamlet, wondering
                    whether or not to act. To intervene or not to
                    intervene? That is always the question when you see
                    something like this – an incident not violent
                    enough to warrant a panicked call to 999, but
                    disturbing enough to make you very worried.</p>

                  <p>As I stood there, I debated. The first thing to be
                    considered was the Snapshot of a Bad Moment
                    possibility. I’ve had my share of Bad Moments
                    myself, and I challenge any honest parent to say
                    otherwise: there were times I’d been so pissy
                    with my kids that, had a stranger seen me in
                    passing, they’d be tempted to send me for a
                    time-out.</p>

                  <p>But as the minutes ticked by, it became clear that
                    this wasn’t a case of just a bad-tempered comment
                    or a single too-rough touch. The woman seemed to
                    have it in for this particular child. Her three
                    other children were sitting placidly with their
                    balloons, and another adult – a husband? A
                    brother? – sat beside her. “Why are you so
                    bad?” she asked the boy. “None of my other
                    children are as bad as you are.”</p>

                  <p>Still, I couldn’t quite screw up the nerve. The
                    bus was packed, but nobody else was doing anything.
                    I found the woman’s behaviour loathesome, but
                    that was my opinion. As the woman herself had
                    pointed out, what one person deems a push might be
                    another person’s punch. What one parent calls
                    discipline, another might call abuse.</p>

                  <p>The boy began to cry.</p>

                  <p>“Now all the other people on this bus are going
                    to have to listen to you crying,” sighed the
                    woman. “I feel for them, I really do.”</p>

                  <p>Time was short: my stop was next. I leaned over.
                    “You know, I actually don’t mind hearing your
                    child crying,” I said evenly, my voice as low as
                    I could manage. “What I do mind is listening to
                    the way you’ve been treating him.”</p>

                  <p>“I don’t know what you do where you’re
                    from,” retorted the woman, who’d picked up on
                    my American accent. “But in this country, we
                    don’t interfere in what’s not our business.”</p>

                  <p>I got off the bus and burst into tears. “That
                    was awful,” said a man who had also got off.
                    “You were right to say something.”</p>

                  <p>But had I been right? Or had I not said enough?
                    Watching the bus pull away, I wondered if I should
                    phone the police. Or whether I should have done
                    that in the first place instead of addressing the
                    mother herself.</p>

                  <p>“We all have a responsibility to speak out when
                    we see a child harmed in public,” says John
                    Cameron, head of child protection services at the
                    <a href="http://www.nspcc.org.uk/">National Society
                    for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a>
                    (NSPCC). “But it’s easier said than done.”</p>

                  <p>The fear of confrontation or even violence and the
                    nuances of each particular situation conspire
                    against there being one definitive answer about
                    whether or not to intervene.</p>

                  <p>Later, when I looked up, “child abuse” on the
                    internet I would eventually find a 2006 Department
                    of Education report, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused">What
                    to do if You’re Worried a Child is being
                    Abused</a>.” But its guidelines were for people
                    who work with children, professionals charged with
                    their care who could observe them over time. It
                    wasn’t so much designed for members of the public
                    who happened to see ugly scenes on buses or in the
                    street or supermarket. I’ve lived in this country
                    for the better part of 20 years and I still
                    didn’t know the standard protocol for such
                    situations. Neither, it turns out, did my British
                    friends. One suggested that I should have gone to
                    the bus driver. Another offered that I should have
                    videoed it for the child protection authorities.</p>

                  <p>That’s what one bus passenger in the US did
                    earlier this month. The video, which went viral on
                    the internet, shows a mother on a public bus in
                    Philadelphia, in what appears to be a drug-induced
                    daze, as her little girl tries to hold her drooping
                    head up. It led to the city’s Department of Human
                    Services removing the child from her mother’s
                    care, according to the Philadelphia media.</p>

                  <p>Despite the video, officials said they were
                    disappointed that more passengers hadn’t
                    complained. “There’s very little reason why 15
                    calls to 911 [emergency services] weren’t
                    received,” a police chief told the Philadelphia
                    Daily News. “I don’t think there’s anyone who
                    can watch that and say, ‘Ah, that’s a shame,’
                    and just walk away.”</p>

                  <p>In my case, I did walk away, increasingly worried
                    that I’d done the wrong thing. Or rather, the
                    right thing in the wrong way. What if the woman,
                    shamed at being called out in public, took it out
                    on the boy at home?</p>

                  <p>Deciding when to intervene in a public space
                    requires “a quick calculation on the degree of
                    risk,” says Sue Berelowitz, deputy children’s
                    commissioner for England. “One does have to
                    think: if I would intervene when I see that parent
                    chastising their child in public, then what the
                    hell are they doing in private?”</p>

                  <p>If you’re a member of the public, the risk is
                    that you don’t know who the child is and have no
                    means of monitoring the family – you have no idea
                    what will happen at home.</p>

                  <p>“Ultimately, the decision of whether a child is
                    a victim of abuse or not lies with social
                    services,” says Berelowitz. “So if you’re
                    worried, call the police. You cannot make that
                    decision. Someone else needs to do the assessment
                    and make the decision.”</p>

                  <p>In a public space, where you don’t want to risk
                    confrontation, or possible violence, one might
                    decide to keep a distance, make the call and then
                    keep the family in your sights until the
                    authorities arrive: “You can decide that you’re
                    not going to let the child out of your sight until
                    the police arrive,” she suggests.</p>

                  <p>If it’s a matter of a parent simply losing their
                    cool with a child, it sometimes works to offer to
                    your help, suggests John Cameron of the NSPCC.
                    “It’s often not productive to go over and
                    confront the parent – people just get defensive.
                    Instead of asking them to justify their behaviour,
                    it can help to go over and say something like,
                    ‘Kids can be really difficult. Is there anything
                    I can do to help?’”</p>

                  <p>Ultimately, say officials, it’s better to err on
                    the side of caution. “There are no defined
                    criteria as to when a person should or should not
                    report the abuse of a child to the authorities,”
                    says Chief Constable Simon Bailey, of the
                    Association of Chief Police Officers. “We would,
                    however, encourage members of the public to
                    exercise their own judgment, erring on the side of
                    caution, and report what they have seen to the
                    police.”</p>

                  <p>That allows the police to assess the incident
                    alongside any other information they may have on
                    the child.</p>

                  <p>I could, it turns out, also have called the
                    NSPCC’s hotline, which receives most of its calls
                    from the public. Last year, in the wake of
                    high-profile abuse scandals, such as the Jimmy
                    Savile case, the volume of calls rose 15%, with
                    callers using words like “duty” and
                    “responsibility” when describing why they
                    called.</p>

                  <p>“If you’re uncertain about something you’ve
                    seen and left feeling uneasy, call,” says
                    Cameron. “We can help you tease through details
                    and figure out what in the picture is important and
                    what’s not.”</p>

                  <p>It’s rare that such calls come in without small
                    clues as to the family’s identity: a school
                    uniform or a license plate number in the car-park
                    can help in tracing them. Once, after someone
                    phoned in a family altercation in a restaurant, the
                    NSPCC worked with the police to find the family
                    through their credit card bill details.</p>

                  <p>As for the boy I saw on the bus, I wish I had
                    phoned a professional, instead of confronting his
                    mother. Or rather than confronting her, had asked
                    her if I could help. I owe him thanks: because of
                    him, I’ll know better next time.</p>

                    child’</em><br/>
                  </h2>

                  <p><em>A few years ago, Sarah was strolling through a
                    shopping centre, when she saw a mother and
                    daughter, aged eight or nine, having a
                    disagreement. When she saw the mother begin to kick
                    and swear at the girl, Sarah stepped in. “You
                    cannot do that to a child,” she told the mother.
                    “It’s completely unacceptable.” </em></p>

                  <p><em>The mother responded by swearing again and
                    telling her to mind her own business. So Sarah
                    spoke directly to the child, who was in tears,
                    telling her that she shouldn’t have to put up
                    with this kind of treatment and that if anything
                    like it ever occurred again, she could call the
                    police. </em></p>

                  <p><em>Approaching the mother, says Sarah, was
                    difficult: “We’re conditioned not to judge
                    other people’s parenting skills. No one likes
                    their parenting skills to be criticised by someone
                    else. You know it’s probably not going to be
                    taken well.”</em></p>

                  <p><em>As helpful as it might be for a child to know
                    there’s an adult questioning their parents’
                    behaviour, it would take a strong child to pick up
                    the phone by themselves to phone the police, says
                    John Cameron, of the NSPCC. </em></p>

                  <p><em>An effective approach is to go in with an
                    offer of help. “Even the toughest of parents tend

                  <p><em> “An offer of help can take the sting out of
                    the situation. I’ve even seen big blokes being
                    aggressive against their children and when you go
                    in and offer a helping hand, it disables them.
                    Sometimes, it’s enough to engage the parent: they
                    want a moment to be able to gain awareness of what
                    they’re doing.” </em></p>

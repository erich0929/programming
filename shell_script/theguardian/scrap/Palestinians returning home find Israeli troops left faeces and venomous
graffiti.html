<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>When Ahmed Owedat returned to his home 18 days after
                Israeli soldiers took it over in the middle of the
                night, he was greeted with an overpowering stench.</p>

              <p>He picked through the wreckage of his possessions
                thrown from upstairs windows to find that the departing
                troops had left a number of messages. One came from
                piles of faeces on his tiled floors and in wastepaper
                baskets, and a plastic bottle filled with urine.</p>

              <p>If that was not clear enough, the words "Fuck <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" title="More from the Guardian on Hamas">Hamas</a>" had
                been carved into a concrete wall in the staircase.
                "Burn <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a> down"
                and "Good Arab = dead Arab" were engraved on a coffee
                table. The star of David was drawn in blue in a
                bedroom.</p>

              <p>"I have scrubbed the floors three times today and
                three times yesterday," said Owedat, 52, as he surveyed
                the damage, which included four televisions, a fridge,
                a clock and several computers tossed out of windows,
                shredded curtains and slashed soft furnishings.</p>

              <p>A handful of plastic chairs had their seats ripped
                open, through which the occupying soldiers defecated,
                he said. Gaping holes had been blown in four
                ground-floor external walls, and there was damage from
                shelling to the top floor. There, in the living room,
                diagrams had been drawn on the walls, showing buildings
                and palm trees in the village, with figures that Owedat
                thought represented their distance from the border.</p>

              <p>"I have no money to fix this," he said, claiming that
                his life savings of $10,000 (£6,000) were missing from
                his apartment. But at least it could be repaired, he
                acknowledged, gesturing through the broken glass at a
                wasteland stretching towards the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on                 Israel">Israel</a>-Gaza border 3km away. "Every house
                between here and there has been destroyed."</p>

              <p>His family of 13 fled their home after seeing troops
                and tanks advancing at 1am on 20 July, two days into
                the Israeli ground invasion. Several times, during the
                short-lived ceasefires in the following two weeks, they
                attempted to return only to find Israeli troops in
                their home instructing them to keep away.</p>

              <p>The Israel Defence Forces did not respond to a request
                for comment.</p>

              <p>Half an hour's drive north, a similar picture was
                found at Beit Hanoun girls' school, taken over by the
                IDF following the ground operation. Broken glass and
                rubble littered the floors and stairs. Tables and desks
                were covered in the abandoned detritus of an occupying
                army: hardened bread rolls, empty tins of hummus,
                desiccated olives, cans of energy drinks, bullet
                casings. Flies buzzed around the rotting food.</p>

              <p>Here too, said the school's caretaker, Fayez, who
                didn't want to give his full name, soldiers had
                defecated in bins and cardboard boxes, and urinated in
                water bottles. "You will be fucked here" and "Don't
                forget it's time for you to die" were chalked in
                English on blackboards.</p>

              <p>Here, Hamas had struck back. After the troops pulled
                out, counter-graffiti was sprayed on the walls,
                referring to Hamas's militant wing, Qassam brigades.
                "Qassam's army will crush you – dogs" and "Israel
                will be defeated".</p>

              <p>The 1,250 pupils at the school will, it is hoped,
                never see either set of venomous messages. Workers
                began the marathon cleanup operation this week but,
                said Fayez, "it will take at least a month to fix". The
                academic year is due to begin in a little over two
                weeks.</p>

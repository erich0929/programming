              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne" title="More from the Guardian on George Osborne">George
                Osborne</a>'s pet cat Freya has been hit by a car.</p>

              <p>The feline, who went missing earlier this year, was
                not seriously injured in the accident on Thursday
                night, a Downing Street spokesman said.</p>

              <p>She was taken to a vet after it is thought she was
                "clipped" at the Ministry of Defence end of the street.
                It is unclear whose car was involved in the incident,
                news of which came on World Cat Day.</p>

              <p>Freya is recovering and expected to return home soon.
                Osborne was said to be "grateful" to those who helped
                his pet and will pay any bills himself.</p>

              <p>In May, Freya was chauffeured back home after turning
                up frightened and lost in Vauxhall where she was found
                by Kate Jones, a homelessness outreach worker, who
                identified her from the tag on her collar.</p>

              <p>Jones, who works with Thames Reach's London Street
                Rescue, said she had lots of experience helping the
                homeless in London but that it was the first time she
                had helped a cat find shelter.</p>

              <p>Freya spent the night on Jones's pillow before being
                collected by Downing Street officials. She had
                travelled south of the river and at least 1.5 miles
                before being found.</p>

              <p>Jones later posted a picture of the cat with a note to
                remind Osborne that while she had been given shelter
                for the night in this instance, most homeless people
                were not so fortunate.</p>

              <p>Freya, who moved to Downing Street with the Osbornes
                in 2010, had reportedly gone missing before after
                disappearing from the family's Notting Hill home in
                2009.</p>

              <p>Questions were raised last year when Osborne added a
                dog to the household at No 11. Lola, a young bichon
                frise, was said to be cat friendly.</p>

              <p>Building societies are forcing home buyers to take out
                their often high-priced in-house <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/insurance" title="More from the Guardian on                 Insurance">insurance</a> policies – or face a penalty
                of as much as £45 if they shop around.</p>

              <p>A survey by comparison site comparethemarket.com named
                Ipswich building society as the worst offender in a
                list of 18 lenders which charge home buyers if they
                choose to buy their buildings insurance at an
                alternative provider. The society charges £45,
                although in a statement it said that it plans to drop
                the charge later this year. Among other lenders, the
                biggest still continuing the practice is Skipton, which
                charges £25.</p>

              <p>A Skipton spokesman said: "There is a charge we make
                to ensure that if someone buys their buildings
                insurance elsewhere, we need to check that the property
                is properly insured."</p>

              <p>But Simon McCulloch of comparethemarket.com said,
                based on the mortgage and remortgage market share of
                those lenders that impose a fee, consumers are
                collectively paying nearly £2m a year for these
                charges.</p>

              <p>"These charges are essentially a tax on being
                financially proactive and prudent," he said. "Shopping
                around for buildings and contents insurance saves a
                third of UK households more than £100, which could,
                for example, pay for your first six months broadband
                after you move house. But charges like these are
                designed to put people off doing this and, in many
                instances, to tie them into more expensive products."</p>

              <p>Tie-in or "bundled" insurances which were a condition
                of signing up for the cheapest home loans were highly
                controversial a decade ago, but were abandoned by the
                major lenders following threats of legislation to ban
                the practice. Lenders can no longer make a loan deal
                conditional upon taking out insurance, but can set a
                fee to check that the buyer has taken out cover.</p>

              <p>At one point lenders were estimated to be earning
                £400m from lucrative commissions earned by selling
                insurance, although as long ago as 1993 Halifax ditched
                its requirement to buy its in-house insurance.
                Nationwide dropped its £25 fee in 1998, but smaller
                societies – such as the Marsden, Mansfield and
                Darlington continue with the practice today, according
                to the comparethemarket research.</p>

              <p>A spokesman for the Ipswich said: "The society has
                recently conducted a review of the 'own insurance'
                mortgage fee. The result of this is that we intend to
                remove this fee for all applications from 1 September
                2014."</p>

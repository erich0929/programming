                largest Christian city was all but abandoned on
                Thursday as the jihadist advance through minority
                communities in the country's north-west rampaged
                towards the Kurdish stronghold of Erbil.</p>

              <p>UN officials said an estimated 200,000 new refugees
                were seeking sanctuary in the Kurdish north from
                Islamic extremists who had pursued them since the
                weekend. The city of Qaraqosh, south-east of Mosul,
                home to around 50,000 Christians was the latest to
                fall, with most residents fleeing before dawn as
                convoys of extremists drew near.</p>

              <p>Other Christian towns near Mosul, including Tel Askof,
                Tel Keif and Qaramless have also largely been emptied.
                Those who remained behind have reportedly been given
                the same stark choice given to other minorities,
                including Yazidis: flee, convert to Islam, or be
                killed.</p>

              <p>Christians, Yazidis and Turkmen have been at the
                frontlines of Iraq's war with the Islamic State (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis" title="More from the Guardian on Isis">Isis</a>) ever
                since the jihadist group stormed into Mosul and Tikrit
                and mid-June. The Iraqi army capitulated within hours,
                with at least 60,000 officers and soldiers fleeing on
                the first day of the assault alone.</p>

              <p>Ever since, the jihadists have continued to make
                advances, while Iraqi troops have concentrated on
                defending Baghdad and the Shia south, leaving the
                defence of minorities in the north to the Kurdish
                peshmurga.</p>

              <p>However, even the much vaunted Kurdish forces were no
                match for the heavy weapons wielded by the jihadists as
                they advanced in recent days. Peshmurga officers
                ordered troops to withdraw to areas administered by the
                Kurdish regional government – a clear sign of
                priorities and of where the battle lines are being
                drawn.</p>

              <p>Without any protection, Yazidis, Christians and
                Turkmen are being uprooted from communities they have
                lived in for millennia and the geo-social fabric of
                Iraq is being rapidly shredded.</p>

              <p>While those who have managed to flee the Christian
                areas have so far had a relatively safe passage to
                Erbil, t<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat" title="">ens of thousands of Yazidis remain besieged on
                a mountain top near Sinjar</a>, with little food or
                water.</p>

              <p>The UN said on Thursday it was able to get some
                supplies overland to the stranded hordes – avoiding
                Isis fighters who have surrounded most of Mount Sinjar.
                Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced that
                Turkish helicopters had dropped food and water on the
                mountain top. Iraqi helicopters have also made food
                drops, but stranded Yazidis say they do not have enough
                to survive.</p>

              <p>The Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk, Joseph Thomas,
                described the situation in northern Iraq as
                "catastrophic, a crisis beyond imagination". He
                demanded urgent intervention to save what remained of
                the area's Christian heritage.</p>

              <p>Kurdish officials on Thursday demanded more help in
                catering for refugees. The Kurdish administered areas
                have seen staggering numbers cross their notional
                border since the original Isis onslaught two months
                ago. In the first week alone, some 500,000 people are
                thought to have fled towards Erbil.</p>

              <p>The capital of the Kurdish north is already home to a
                new Chaldean Christian community, which fled Baghdad in
                the wake of an Isis-led massacre inside a cathedral in
                October 2010. Many fleeing Christians have headed for
                the Ainkawa neighbourhood, which is home to Baghdad's
                Christian exiles.</p>

              <p>The past 11 years of war and insurrection since the US
                invasion have led to most of Iraq's Christians fleeing.
                Numbers have plummeted starkly from an estimated one
                million before 2003 to around 150,000 now. A large
                number of those who remain are now displaced.</p>

              <p>Miriam Dagher, 53, from Qaraqosh, said churches in the
                city had already been torched and religious insignia
                smashed. "We stayed as long as we could," she said.
                "But nothing could save us. This is the end of our
                community."</p>

              <p>Isis has threatened to redraw the unitary borders that
                were carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. The
                group's rampant insurgency and the inability of state
                actors to stop it has rendered the frontier between
                Iraq and Syria evermore irrelevant.</p>

              <p>In the absence of central government authority, Shia
                militias are taking dominant roles, amplifying
                sectarian enmity between Islam's two most dominant
                sects.</p>

              <p>Iraq's beleaguered prime minister, Nour al-Maliki, no
                longer has the authority to unite the country's
                disparate sects. Maliki, a Shia Muslim, had
                disenfranchised much of the country's Sunni community
                over the past three years, some of whom have turned to
                Isis as a means of reasserting themselves.</p>

              <p>After digging in for the past two months, Maliki now
                faces a desperate battle to form a government, with his
                key backer Iran understood to have told him that it no
                longer supports his bid to lead the country for a third
                term.</p>

              <p>Kurdish leader, Massoud Barazani, has said he is
                moving towards holding a referendum that could pave the
                way for an independence bid, a move that could spell
                the end of Iraq, and unsettle surrounding countries,
                including Syria, Turkey and Iran.</p>

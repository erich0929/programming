              <p>A yes vote for independence would break up the UK
                single market and in the short-term could leave
                Scottish businesses uncertain of their position in
                Europe, the all-party business select committee has
                said in a report.</p>

              <p>A protracted Scottish negotiation over EU membership,
                and the uncertain investment environment arising from a
                vote in favour of independence, would involve "a leap
                of faith" and would have a damaging impact on
                businesses in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scotland">Scotland</a>
                as well as other parts of the UK, it says.</p>

              <p>The legal advice surrounding an independent Scotland's
                place in Europe should be published, it adds.</p>

              <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is due to give a
                speech to Scottish business leaders in Glasgow on
                Friday, where he will attack Alex Salmond's
                difficulties in explaining what he would do if an
                independent Scotland is deprived of access to the
                pound.</p>

              <p>The committee raises serious concerns that a yes vote
                may leave Scotland facing a currency "limbo" and, in
                the short term, unable to join a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling" title="More from the Guardian on Sterling">sterling</a>
                currency union and without the prospect of adopting the
                euro.</p>

              <p>Adrian Bailey, chair of the committee, said: "On big
                questions, such as the issue of a future currency, it's
                time for the Scottish government to come clean and lay
                out the detail. It's no longer tenable for the Scottish
                government to assert an independent Scotland will
                retain the pound when a sterling currency union is
                firmly off the table.</p>

              <p>"The Scottish government must play fair with Scottish
                businesses, investors, and voters and set out its plans
                for an alternative currency for an independent
                Scotland."</p>

              <p>The report says: "Scotland would become a member of
                the European Union at some point in the future. It is a
                leap of faith to believe that this would either happen
                automatically or that re-admission would be a swift
                affair. There would be a period of intense and complex
                negotiation and the terms of those could be damaging to
                business and citizens.</p>

              <p>"A protracted period of negotiation beyond the
                proposed 18 months would have a negative impact on
                business in Scotland as well as the other parts of the
                United Kingdom. There is a substantial risk that
                Scotland could be cut adrift in the short to medium
                term from its largest economic market. The impact of
                this on Scottish business would be significant."</p>

              <p>Bailey added: "It is highly unlikely that the EU would
                permit a sterling zone. Furthermore, we do not believe
                that the use by a separate Scotland of a 'shadow pound'
                would be acceptable to the EU."</p>

              <p>The committee says the Scottish government's stated
                intention to renationalise the Royal Mail upon
                achieving independence is an uncosted aspiration,
                bereft of any detail of how it is to be paid for or how
                it would be done.</p>

              <p>It raises fears for the future of the universal postal
                obligation – under which letters are delivered to any
                UK destination at a set price – in an independent
                Scotland, with its continued survival likely to be
                secured only at significant additional cost, either to
                the taxpayer or to the consumer.</p>

              <p>It also warns: "The current policy of charging tuition
                fees for non-domiciled UK students provides a
                significant source of income to Scottish universities.
                Despite the special circumstances highlighted by the
                Scottish government, it is highly doubtful that this
                policy will be compatible with EU membership. The
                Scottish government must therefore set out how it will
                replace the financial shortfall of not being able to
                levy tuition fees only on students from the rest of the
                United Kingdom."</p>

              <p>The former Marks &amp; Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose,
                the football executive and Apprentice star <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/karren-brady" title="More from the Guardian on Karren Brady">Karren
                Brady</a>, the publisher Gail Rebuk, and the former
                Tory pollster Andrew Cooper are among the list of new
                working peers announced by Downing Street.</p>

              <p>Of the 22, there are 12 Conservative peers, six <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats" title="More from the Guardian on Liberal                 Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, three <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour" title="More from the Guardian on Labour">Labour</a> and
                one Democratic Unionist. Half are women.</p>

              <p>Brady, the vice-chairman of West Ham United, is also
                small business ambassador for the Tories and a member
                of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's women
                in sport advisory board.</p>

              <p>Other Tories granted peerages include Dido Harding,
                the chief executive of TalkTalk; and Martin Callanan,
                former leader of the Tory MEPs and the European <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives" title="More from the Guardian on                 Conservatives">Conservatives</a> and Reformists group.</p>

              <p>A peerage has also been given to Carlyn Chisholm, the
                co-chairman of the Conservative candidates' committee;
                Natalie Evans, director of the New Schools Network, the
                charity supporting groups wanting to set up free
                schools; Michael Farmer, the Conservative party
                treasurer; and Arminka Helic, the former special
                adviser to the ex-foreign secretary, William Hague.
                Helic was the driving force behind efforts to take
                action on violence against women in war.</p>

              <p>Nosheena Mobarik, chairman of the Pakistan Britain
                Trade and Investment Forum, has been rewarded for her
                work as advocate of ethic minorities in business.
                Another prominent Tory-supporting businesswoman, Joanna
                Shields, the prime minister's digital adviser and chair
                of Tech City UK, is also elevated.</p>

              <p>As previously reported, Ranbir Suri, a businessman and
                long-term Tory donor, has also been made a lord by
                Cameron.</p>

              <p>Labour has been given three peerages, including for
                the former actor Michael Cashman, now an MEP and gay
                rights campaigner.</p>

              <p>Ed Miliband has continued the long tradition of giving
                peerages to former party officials by awarding one to
                Chris Lennie, a former Labour deputy general secretary.</p>

              <p>Dame Gail Rebuck, the publisher and chairman of
                Penguin Random House, has also been chosen by Miliband
                to be a peer. She was married to Phillip Gould, the
                Labour pollster who died of cancer in 2011..</p>

              <p>The Lib Dems have given peerages to some key figures
                in its now-decimated local government base. As well as
                a peerage for Chris Fox, the party's former chief
                executive, ermine consolation prizes have gone to David
                Goddard, the former leader of Stockport council;
                Barbara Janke, the former leader of Bristol council;
                Kath Pinnock, the former leader of Kirklees council;
                and Paul Scriven, the former leader of Sheffield
                council.</p>

              <p>Dr Julie Smith, a senior lecturer in international
                relations at Cambridge University, has also been made a
                peer and will lend foreign policy expertise to the
                party.</p>

              <p>The Democratic Unionists nominated William Hay,
                speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. He will sit
                on the crossbenches.</p>

              <p>Miliband said his three nominees brought experience
                and talent to the Lords. He said: "Throughout his life
                Michael Cashman has been a passionate defender of human
                rights. As a founder of Stonewall and a member of the
                European parliament he has fought tirelessly for LGBT
                people.</p>

              <p>"Gail Rebuck has made a huge contribution to British
                business. As one of the founders of World Book Day she
                has also helped millions of young people experience the
                joy of reading. Chris Lennie has been a valued servant
                of the labour and trade union movements and a lifelong
                charity fundraiser. I am sure he will bring this
                perspective and experience to his work in the Lords.</p>

              <p>"All three will be real assets to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords" title="More from the Guardian on House of Lords">House
                of Lords</a> over the years to come."</p>

              <p>Nick Clegg said:‬"Our new peers highlight the
                campaigning heartbeat of our party, standing up for
                their local areas and championing the Liberal Democrat
                cause to deliver a stronger economy and a fairer
                society."</p>

              <p>Labour pointed out that 13 peers created by David
                Cameron since becoming prime minister were Tory donors,
                including Farmer and Suri. The 13 have collectively
                given the Tories more than £22m, Labour claimed.
                Farmer alone has donated £5.9m.</p>

              <p>The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said: "By
                repeatedly promoting Tory donors who have given him
                millions of pounds to the Lords, David Cameron proves
                again who he stands up for."</p>

              <p>The Tories pointed out that Miliband had himself given
                a peerage to one of the people responsible for raising
                donations for Labour, Lord Mendelsohn, and insisted the
                cost of running the House of Lords had fallen. The Lib
                Dems pointed out that none of its peerages had gone to
                donors.</p>

              <p>The number of Liberal peers is in three figures for
                the first time since the late 1920s, underlining the
                significant role the party's peers may play after the
                general election, even if Nick Clegg's party is not
                asked or is unwilling to create a second coalition.</p>

              <p>Ukip complained that Cameron had denied Nigel Farage's
                party any peerages, despite its strong showing in the
                European and local elections.</p>

              <h3 id="design-update">Design update</h3>

              <p>We have spent two years introducing a new design for
                the Guardian website, taking care to ensure improved
                accessibility. This design has now been applied to the
                majority of pages, however some still remain such as
                User registration / sign-in and these will not yet have
                the same level of accessibility or some of the features
                listed below.</p>

              <p></p>

              <h3 id="text-resizing">Text resizing</h3>

              <p>The modern browsers we support (Firefox 3.6 and later,
                Internet Explorer 7 and later, Chrome (latest version)
                and Safari 4.x and later) feature in-built
                accessibility tools, including zoom and text-resizing.</p>

              <p>You can change the text size or adjust the page zoom
                in your browser by following these instructions:</p>

              <p><strong>• PC / Internet Explorer 7</strong> From the
                menu bar underneath the search field, select
                <strong>Page</strong> and point to <strong>Text
                size</strong></p>

              <p><strong>• PC / other browsers</strong>
                <strong>Increase</strong> page zoom: Hold down the
                <strong>CTRL</strong> key and press <strong>+</strong>
                <strong>Decrease</strong> page zoom: Hold down the
                <strong>CTRL </strong>key and
                press&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></p>

              <p><strong>• Mac / all browsers</strong>
                <strong>Increase</strong> page zoom: Hold down the
                <strong>Command</strong> key and press
                <strong>+</strong> <strong>Decrease</strong> page zoom:
                Hold down the <strong>Command</strong> key and
                press&nbsp;<strong>-</strong></p>

              <p></p>

              <h3 id="access-keys">Access keys</h3>

              <p>These can be accessed in the following way:</p>

              <p>• PC: hold down <strong>Alt</strong> <br/>
                • Mac: hold down <strong>Ctrl</strong> <br/>
                • Firefox 2: hold down <strong>Alt and Shift</strong></p>

              <p>Then press one of the keys listed below:</p>

              <p><strong>'s'</strong> to jump to the
                <strong>content</strong> <br/>
                <strong>'0'</strong> to jump to the site
                <strong>navigation</strong> <br/>
                <strong>'4'</strong> to jump to the site
                <strong>search</strong> <br/>
                <strong>'8'</strong> to see our <strong>terms and
                conditions</strong> <br/>
                <strong>'c'</strong> to jump to the
                <strong>comments</strong> (where comments are
                available).</p>

              <p></p>

              <h3 id="user-commenting">User commenting</h3>

              <p>We have recently increased the accessibility of our
                commenting section by no longer using Javascript to
                view the comments. A more technical explanation can be
                found on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2009/nov/06/comments-included">Inside
                the Guardian website blog</a>. Some areas still require
                Javascript such as reporting abuse and recommending
                comments.</p>

              <p>The following items should serve to further help users
                in this area:</p>

              <p><strong>• Access key 'c'</strong> (as mentioned in
                the section above) has been added to provide a link
                that moves the user directly to the start of the
                comments.</p>

              <p><strong>• RSS feeds of comments</strong> are
                available so you can view them using an RSS reader,
                such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/#overview-page">Google
                Reader</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>• </strong>We have ensured that the
                <strong>text resizing</strong> code and other features
                work with the comments.</p>

              <p><strong>• Comments are keyboard navigable.</strong></p>

              <p></p>

              <h3 id="recent-improvements">Recent site improvements</h3>

              <p><strong>1.</strong> Crumb navigation not dependent
                upon Javascript to display the arrow images.</p>

              <p><strong>2.</strong> Sliding caption column: changed
                heading colour to a monochrome scheme to improve
                readability.</p>

              <p><strong>3.</strong> Breaking news ticker: lowered its
                CPU usage and removed the iframe, making it easier to
                access for users browsing with a keyboard or any
                assistive technology.</p>

              <p><strong>4.</strong> Display of comments not dependent
                upon Javascript.</p>

              <p><strong>5.</strong> Large text-size wide-layout rolled
                out across all pages.</p>

              <p></p>

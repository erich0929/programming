              <p>The last time Daoud saw his son was when the
                24-year-old joined his family to break the Ramadan fast
                in their overcrowded apartment in Rafah, south <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" title="More from the Guardian on Gaza">Gaza</a>.</p>

              <p>"He stayed for an hour or two. He was killed later
                during the night… I learned about it from
                neighbours," Daoud, a steel worker, said.</p>

              <p>Daoud's son, Ibrahim, was a fighter with the Izz
                ad-Din Al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" title="More from the Guardian on Hamas">Hamas</a>. A
                graduate in education who had joined the police, he
                died with five others in an Israeli airstrike on 8
                July. The corrugated iron fence outside his home has
                been daubed with a verse from the Qur'an asking God to
                accept his martyrdom.</p>

              <p>As war returned to Gaza on Friday, many outside
                observers were asking why Hamas and the other smaller
                Islamist groups active in Gaza had let the ceasefire
                lapse and fired dozens of rockets into <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a>.
                One answer lies in the resilience of a movement
                carefully built over decades, and deeply embedded in
                the community.</p>

              <p>A key question is the level of casualties sustained by
                Hamas, an acronym for the Harakat al Muqawamma Islamiya
                (Islamic Resistance Movement) so far in this most
                recent war.</p>

              <p>Israeli military officials have said up to 900
                fighters from Hamas and other smaller factions in Gaza
                such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad have been killed.
                These figures are largely based on reports from Israeli
                units fighting in Gaza.</p>

              <p>"They were reporting a lot of success, five guys, ten
                guys, 20 guys killed. These were big engagements," said
                Daniel Nisman, an Israeli security analyst and
                commentator.</p>

              <p>Last week Yossi Kuperwasser, Israeli minister for
                strategic affairs, told reporters: "Hamas has lost more
                and more during the war – the tunnels, thousands of
                rockets and hundreds of operatives. Every day that went
                by, they lost more."</p>

              <p>It does appear that dozens of sophisticated tunnels
                leading from Gaza into Israel, which could permit
                cross-border raids to kill or kidnap civilians and
                soldiers, have been destroyed. More than 3,000 rockets
                have been fired on Israel from Gaza – killing three
                people - which Israeli officials insist is at least
                half of Hamas total stocks of the weapons.</p>

              <p>However few senior Hamas military commanders appear to
                have died.</p>

              <p>"Most of the casualties were from anti-tank missile
                cells or lost on motorbikes. These were low-level guys
                bouncing between missile positions, particularly in
                border areas," Nisman said.</p>

              <p>When last week a missile struck a street metres from
                the gates of a United Nations school in Rafah, killing
                nine, Israeli military spokesmen said they had been
                targeting "terrorists on a motorbike" nearby.</p>

              <p>Khaleel Habeel, a Islamic Jihad official in Gaza,
                admitted casualties, saying‚ "if you take on the
                fourth most powerful army in the world then of course
                you lose people." Ziad Abu Oda of the Mujahideen
                Faction splinter group told the Guardian his
                organisation had lost 50 men, including fighters and
                political officials.</p>

              <p>But even top-end estimates of casualties would be a
                fraction of the strength of Hamas' military brigades
                and other groups, which are believed to have 10,000
                fighters permanently under arms, with another 10,000
                reservists who can be mobilised.</p>

              <p>The intensity of the fighting also surprised Israeli
                commanders, with Hamas deploying powerful sniper
                rifles, using tunnels and a range of new tactics to
                kill 64 Israeli soldiers.</p>

              <p>In Khuzaar, a border village badly damaged in
                intensive fighting, another father, who did not want to
                be named, described how his son and six other local men
                had hidden in Khuzaar to ambush Israeli troops. All
                seven were killed.</p>

              <p>Hamas, which was founded by Islamist ideologues in
                Gaza more than 25 years ago and is linked to the Muslim
                Brotherhood movement, has run orphanages, clinics,
                schools and youth activities through its social wing.
                These aim both to recruit for the military brigades and
                consolidate the group's broader support base in Gaza.</p>

              <p>The aims of the political wing too are subordinate to
                those of the organisation. "If it is a choice between
                government and the movement, the movement is always the
                priority," said Omar Shaban, a Gaza-based analyst.</p>

              <p>Shaban said the group's insistence that Israel eases,
                or entirely raises, the eight-year blockade of Gaza
                showed Hamas was in touch with the people. The blockade
                has crippled the economy, sending unemployment soaring
                and incomes plunging.</p>

              <p>People in Gaza expressed almost unanimous support for
                the decision to return to hostilities on Friday,
                despite the deaths of around 1,800 people, mainly
                civilians - though some are undoubtedly afraid to
                criticise the group openly.</p>

              <p>At Friday prayers, one cleric told his congregation
                that the community would emerge stronger from the
                conflict.</p>

              <p>Not far away, around thirty children played and five
                adults slumbered through the hot hours of the afternoon
                in the basement of another overcrowded, crumbling
                building. Three of the four sons of Mohamed Ahmed
                Abdulhadi Hamed, 75, had been killed in an airstrike on
                their home in the town of Beit Hanoun four weeks ago.
                Eighteen of the children, including 11 boys, are now
                orphans and homeless.</p>

              <p>Hamed admitted that one of his sons, 38-year-old
                Hafiz, had held a senior rank in Palestinian Islamic
                Jihad, perhaps the only faction to lose a significant
                number of senior commanders in the conflict so far.</p>

              <p>"What do you think these boys will do when they become
                men?" Hamed asked. "Of course this will push these
                children to join the resistance. If someone kills your
                father do you leave him alone?"</p>

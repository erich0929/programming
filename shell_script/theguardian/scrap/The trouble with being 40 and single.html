                  <p>When a single person reaches their 40th birthday,
                    they ought to get a letter from the Queen, just
                    like centenarians do. The letter might congratulate
                    the pitiable sod on making it thus far against all
                    the odds, without strangling any friends for
                    innocently asking “So, are you seeing anyone?”
                    or remarking “Let’s face it, you’re not
                    getting any younger”. Let’s face it, with the
                    exception of Benjamin Button, nobody is getting any
                    younger, but thanks for pointing out how
                    particularly salient it is in my case.</p>

                  <p>Every billboard, every magazine, every
                    acquaintance, every romantic comedy is asking me to
                    pick a mould to pour myself into: hopeless
                    romantic, hedonistic bachelor or desperate
                    spinster. I have tried all three. None fit. Even <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2718552/George-Clooney-Amal-Alamuddins-official-wedding-banns-revealed-displayed-London.html" title="">George Clooney is getting married</a>.</p>

                  <p>I have made half-hearted attempts to address my
                    pariah status, to never again face that tilt of the
                    head accompanied by an “awww”. A couple of
                    years ago, I dated extensively. I found that, after
                    an 11-year relationship, I didn’t know how.</p>

                  <p>I then joined <a href="http://www.gaydar.net/" title="">Gaydar</a>. Again, I did it wrong. The
                    first message I received laconically inquired:
                    “Cock pic?” and obligingly attached a sample
                    from the sender. That pretty much set the tone.
                    After a couple of months of exploring casual
                    encounters, I found myself thinking: “Look,
                    we’ve discussed precisely what we’re going to
                    do for hours. We’ve exchanged pictures, videos,
                    diagrams and scale models. Do we have to actually
                    do it? Only, this thing about the influence of
                    expressionism on silent cinema is about to start on
                    BBC4.” Friends inform me that straight hook-up
                    sites are no better.</p>

                  <p>I joined <a href="https://soulmates.theguardian.com/" title="">Guardian Soulmates</a> and after a while
                    found myself thinking: “Look, we’ve discussed
                    this BBC4 thing about the influence of
                    expressionism on silent cinema for days. Any chance
                    of a shag?”</p>

                  <p>During a brief but terrifying episode, I even
                    joined <a href="http://grindr.com/" title="">Grindr</a> – a phone application that
                    shows you how many gay men are around and their
                    distance. I was Bill Paxton in Aliens: “30 feet,
                    20 feet, 10, five… They’re inside the room.
                    They’re right on top of us! Game over, man, game
                    over.” I deleted the application, returned the
                    phone to factory settings, switched it off, burned
                    it, then put it in the freezer.</p>

                  <p>I even went on a blind date recently. The friend
                    who set me up (and to whom I may never speak again)
                    believed, like an inexplicable number of straight
                    women, that the two single gay men she knew would
                    “get on like a house on fire” because they are
                    both “hilarious”. I went. Don’t judge me –
                    my situation was desperate. I had thought single
                    was a fairly absolute situation. I hadn’t though
                    it possible to feel “singler”. Then equal
                    marriage legislation was passed and suddenly I felt
                    exactly that. So I went.</p>

                  <p>“A little younger,” she had said. Any younger
                    and the placenta would have still been attached.
                    This has been a feature of my singlehood. The
                    moment I clicked over 40, I magically transformed
                    into the most desirable person for vacuous yoof.
                    Apparently, I am a bear or a cub or an otter or a
                    panda or a marmoset or a platypus or something –
                    I don’t know exactly – for attractive, perky
                    people who only serve to remind me how much older I
                    am and with whom I have nothing in common. I told
                    you, I am no good at this.</p>

                  <p>So I sat there and attempted to make small talk,
                    to take a reasoned view on who is better – Pink
                    or Gaga. I tried to find nice things to say about
                    his Alexander McQueen manbag, a source of great
                    pride.</p>

                  <p>After a while, and while I was considering using
                    the flambéed dessert to set fire to my hair just
                    to restore sensation to the head region, the
                    conversation turned to star signs. Innocently, I
                    asked him when his birthday was. “Fourth of
                    December 1990,” he responded. A date is all I
                    needed, no year was necessary. “How about you?”
                    he retorted. “Oh, me? 30th of January.” Silence
                    followed “January”, where a year might have
                    been. It fell between us with a thud.</p>

                  <p>Finally, it was over. Polite goodbyes, awkward
                    little peck, done. As I was walking home, I
                    received the following text message: “Had gr8
                    time wnt 2c more of u y is a hot d8 like u sngl?
                    LOL.” I said I was busy.</p>

                  <p>But the question, mangled as it was, stayed with
                    me: y is a hot date like me sngl? The truth is I am
                    at an awkward age, caught between hopeless
                    romantic, hedonistic bachelor and desperate
                    spinster. I am not jaded enough to compromise for
                    someone who is not a good match, too old to enjoy
                    mindless hedonism and not old enough to resign
                    myself to my situation.</p>

                  <p>Until the underlying facts change, I’ll just
                    have to be single. And, if I can shed 40 years of
                    propaganda, I may come to feel what my mind already
                    knows to be true: it doesn’t mean I am broken or
                    incomplete in some way. Despite that traitor
                    Clooney.</p>

              <p>My 25-year <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marriage" title="More from the Guardian on Marriage">marriage</a>
                has been a loveless mistake. My high-earning wife holds
                the cards. I am mostly the housekeeper, which is fine,
                but I am taken for granted, belittled, ignored, and
                disrespected. I know she is unhappy too, and I would
                prefer just to calmly discuss with her our need for a
                total break. But she is deeply dishonest with herself
                and others, and her response is likely to be
                catastrophic. I have no personal resources or support
                network whatever. What to do? I am absolutely desperate
                for love, affection, touch, companionship,
                conversation. I am a fit 58, a decent human being, and
                I want to live.</p>

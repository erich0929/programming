                  <p>Associated Press= WASHINGTON (AP) â The
                    Federal Aviation Administration said it is
                    prohibiting U.S. airlines and other commercial
                    carriers from flying over Iraq as the U.S. launched
                    its first airstrikes there Friday.</p>

                  <p>The FAA notice to pilots says its action was
                    prompted by the "potentially hazardous situation
                    created by fighting between militants associated
                    with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and
                    Iraqi security forces and their allies."</p>

                  <p>The ban applies to all U.S.-registered planes
                    except those operated by foreign carriers and to
                    FAA-licensed pilots. There is an exception for
                    flights operated with U.S. government permission
                    and for emergency situations.</p>

                  <p>The FAA previously had limited flights over Iraq
                    to altitudes no lower than 30,000 feet.</p>

                  <p>The FAA ban comes just three weeks after a
                    Malaysia Airlines plane with nearly 300 people on
                    board was shot down over eastern Ukraine. No
                    warning had been issued to airlines before the
                    shootdown, and other airlines had been flying over
                    the region. U.S. intelligence and aviation
                    officials said the U.S. had no prior intelligence
                    to indicate separatists intended to target civil
                    aircraft, and the first indication that separatists
                    had an operable SA-11 missile system was on July
                    17, the day of the crash.</p>

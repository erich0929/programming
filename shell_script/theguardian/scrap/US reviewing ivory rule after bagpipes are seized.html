                  <p>Associated Press= CONCORD, N.H. (AP) â The
                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will review its
                    rules about ivory imports after two New Hampshire
                    teenagers had their bagpipes seized at the Canadian
                    border, a spokesman said Friday.</p>

                  <p>The spokesman, Neil Mendelsohn, said customs
                    agents at the Highgate Springs, Vermont, border
                    crossing were following established laws designed
                    to prevent the import and export of illegally
                    harvested ivory when they seized pipes belonging to
                    Campbell Webster and Eryk Bean, a pair of
                    17-year-olds who compete on an international level.
                    Ivory harvested since 1976 is banned in the U.S.</p>

                  <p>"Our headquarters is examining this and looking at
                    the policy and the regulations understanding that
                    musicians do have a unique situation," Mendelsohn
                    said. "And we try to be reasonable, but for right
                    now the rules are the rules. Any instrument these
                    days could be made from elephant parts that might
                    not be an antique."</p>

                  <p>The discord started Sunday when Campbell and Eryk
                    were driving back from Canada after a competition
                    that served as a tuneup for next weekend's World
                    Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland.
                    Campbell's pipes date to 1936 and were played by
                    his father, Gordon Webster, who was the 9th
                    Sovereign Piper to Queen Elizabeth II of England.</p>

                  <p>Because Highgate Springs is a "nondesignated"
                    crossing, they needed extra permits and inspection
                    fees totaling $576 to carry the pipes, with their
                    ivory projecting mounts, across the border. They
                    didn't have the paperwork and the pipes were
                    confiscated for a day. The boys eventually got
                    their pipes back and are in Glasgow, where their
                    adventure has been the talk of the competition,
                    Campbell's mother, Lezlie, said Friday.</p>

                  <p>"It's about time they think about (amending the
                    rules)," she said. "We are not exporters. We are
                    not importers. We are just carrying it on our
                    person and playing music.</p>

                  <p>Mendelsohn said the added fees at nondesignated
                    crossings are needed to recoup the expense of
                    inspections at the border. He maintains that the
                    musicians knew the rules beforehand, though Lezlie
                    Webster disputes that.</p>

                  <p>There are no "designated" land crossings in the
                    Northeast; the nearest designated crossing is
                    Boston's Logan Airport, meaning to avoid the extra
                    fees and paperwork, they'd have to fly to Canada.</p>

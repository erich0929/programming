              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes" title="More from the Guardian on The Times">The
                Times</a> is under attack for refusing to run an advert
                about the conflict in Gaza. The paper is accused of
                being part of a British media "infamously skewed
                against <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a>."</p>

              <p>The ad is a statement, written jointly by Elie Wiesel,
                the Nobel prize-winning author, and Shmuley Boteach, an
                outspoken American-born Orthodox rabbi.</p>

              <p>It calls on President Obama and other political
                leaders across the world "to condemn <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" title="More from the Guardian on Hamas">Hamas</a>'s use
                of children as human shields", which amounts to "child
                sacrifice".</p>

              <p>The advert has been carried in five US newspapers,
                including the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times" title="More from the Guardian on New York Times">New
                York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post" title="More from the Guardian on Washington                 Post">Washington Post</a> and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/wallstreetjournal" title="More from the Guardian on Wall Street                 Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, which is published by
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation" title="More from the Guardian on News Corporation">News
                Corporation</a>, the owner of The Times. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian" title="More from the Guardian on The Guardian">The
                Guardian</a> has agreed to run the advert on Monday.</p>

              <p><a href="http://observer.com/2014/08/exclusive-london-times-rejects-elie-weisel-advertisement-condemning-hamas/">The
                New York Observer, which also ran the ad, reports</a>
                that a Times representative wrote to the agency that
                sought to place the advert to say that "the opinion
                being expressed is too strong and too forcefully made
                and will cause concern amongst a significant number of
                Times readers."</p>

              <p>The ad was paid for by an organisation called <a href="http://thisworld.us/">This World: The Values
                Network</a>, which was founded by Boteach. He responded
                by telling the Observer:</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>"At a time when Israel is fighting for its very
                  existence against the genocidal terrorists of Hamas,
                  the British media, already infamously skewed against
                  Israel, refuses a paid ad that every major American
                  outlet... was proud to run as a full page ad."</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>He described Wiesel as "one of the most respected
                human beings alive" and "the living face of the
                holocaust." He said: "I am shocked that the Times would
                engage in censorship of the worst kind to cater to the
                bigotry [of Hamas]".</p>

              <p>Shmuley said his offer to the Times to revise the
                advertisement was dismissed. The agency was told that
                the decision not to accept ad was not open to
                negotiation.</p>

              <p>A Times spokeswoman told the Guardian: "We reserve the
                right to reject advertisements."</p>

              <p>Referring to the Guardian's decision to run the
                advert, <a href="http://observer.com/2014/08/exclusive-the-guardian-accepts-the-elie-weisel-ad-rejected-by-london-times/">the
                Observer quoted an unidentified source "with knowledge
                of the Values Network's ad-buying practices"</a> as
                saying:</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>"The Guardian may be left wing but they obviously
                  believe in free speech and allowing their readers to
                  hear the voice of a Nobel laureate about a very
                  important issue."</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>But the Guardian's acceptance of an advert does not
                mean, of course, that it endorses the views and claims
                made within it.</p>

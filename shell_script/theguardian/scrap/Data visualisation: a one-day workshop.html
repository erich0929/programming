                teaching materials, nothing tells a complex story

                memorable static and interactive infographics – from
                how to find data and tailor it to your audience, to how
                to create maximum impact with your design.</p>

                Frost</strong>, formerly of the Guardian's Digital

              <h2>Course description</h2>

              <p>This masterclass will look at how raw data can be
                turned into striking visual stories, including both
                flat graphic design (infographics) and interactives.
                There will be two workshops in this masterclass in
                which participants will be asked to collaborate on
                creating their own visualisations before presenting
                back to the group. Topics covered on the day
                include:<br/>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>The importance of good visual storytelling</li>

                <li>Designing and presenting graphs and charts to
                  maximise their impact and memorability</li>

                <li>How to find and analyse data, and match it to the
                  needs of your audience</li>

                <li>The evolution of data visualisation, and examples
                  of best practice<br/>
                  Please note: Although we do discuss the different
                  visualisation software options available, this is not
                  a software training course</li>

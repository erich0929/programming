              <p>Dental experts have found a worrying lack of agreement
                on how people should brush their teeth, a study by the
                British Dental Journal has found.</p>

              <p>Researchers looked at brushing advice given by dental
                associations across 10 countries, toothbrush and
                toothpaste companies and in dental textbooks and found
                the results to be "unacceptably inconsistent".</p>

              <p>The study found differing recommendations on what
                method to use when brushing, how often to brush and how
                long people should brush for.</p>

              <p>Senior author Aubrey Sheiham, emeritus professor of
                dental public health at University College London's
                department of Epidemiology and Public Health, said:
                "The public needs to have sound information on the best
                method to brush their teeth.</p>

              <p>"If people hear one thing from a dental association,
                another from a toothbrush company and something else
                from their dentist, no wonder they are confused about
                how to brush. In this study we found an unacceptably
                inconsistent array of advice from different sources."</p>

              <p>Giving advice on teeth brushing, Prof Sheiham said:
                "Brush gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing
                motion, with the brush at a forty-five degree angle to
                get to the dental plaque.</p>

              <p>"To avoid brushing too hard, hold the brush with a
                pencil grip rather than a fist. This simple method is
                perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy.</p>

              <p>"There is little point in brushing after eating sweets
                or sugary drinks to prevent tooth decay. It takes
                bacteria from food about two minutes to start producing
                acid, so if you brush your teeth a few minutes after
                eating sugary foods, the acid will have damaged the
                enamel."</p>

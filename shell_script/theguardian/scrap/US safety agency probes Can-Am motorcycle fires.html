                  <p> DETROIT (AP) â U.S. safety regulators are
                    investigating two reports of fires in Can-Am Spyder
                    three-wheeled motorcycles.</p>

                  <p>The probe covers about 52,000 motorcycles from the
                    2008 through 2014 model years.</p>

                  <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
                    says in documents posted Friday that the fires
                    appear to be unrelated to three recalls of the
                    motorcycles. One Spyder was destroyed last month in
                    a fire while being used by the Morgantown, West
                    Virginia, Police Department. Another burned in the
                    Mojave Desert region of California.</p>

                  <p>The safety agency says it will look into what
                    caused the fires. Investigations can lead to
                    recalls.</p>

                  <p>The motorcycles are made by Bombardier
                    Recreational Products Inc. of Canada. Messages were
                    left seeking comment from the company.</p>

                  <p>The Morgantown police, in a July 23 complaint to
                    NHTSA, said an officer was riding the Spyder on a
                    city street and felt heat rising from beneath the
                    motorcycle. The officer saw flames coming from the
                    engine and moved it to the side of the road.
                    "Within seconds the vehicle was fully engulfed and
                    flames caught a yard and two nearby trees on fire,"
                    the complaint said.</p>

                  <p>The Fire Department and a city mechanic determined
                    that the fuel system was the source of the blaze,
                    the complaint said.</p>

                  <p>No one was injured in either fire, but the police
                    motorcycle was a total loss.</p>

                  <p>The three recalls happened in 2012 and 2013, and
                    all involved the risk of fires. Last year, the
                    company recalled about 8,200 Spyders because brake
                    fluid leaks could cause fires. In 2012 it recalled
                    about 34,000 because fuel vapors could leak due to
                    an ill-fitting gas cap. It also recalled 9,600
                    because fuel vapors could exit a vent hose in the
                    engine compartment.</p>

                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>A number of years ago I started a forest garden in
                    the middle of a very wet woodland, in the midst of
                    a slug stronghold – I could easily collect a
                    large jarful of them at dusk. But after an
                    intensive research and learning process with many
                    failures, I now only need go out once a week or so
                    to gather up slugs, and even then I only find a
                    few. There are many tips about how to fight these
                    invertebrates circuiting around allotments and
                    gardens – some are fables, some are more
                    effective than others. No single thing does the
                    trick. The solution is to create an ecosystem in
                    your garden to help to create a balance. It sounds
                    easier than it is, but it greatly increases the joy
                    gained from your garden, and once established it
                    looks after itself.</p>

                  <h2>1. Know your enemy</h2>

                  <p>There are many different kinds of slugs and some
                    are more harmful than others. The large black slug
                    doesn’t do much damage at all as they prefer
                    rotting matter, dung and carrion over living
                    plants. The garden slug is the opposite, attacking
                    anything that even slightly resembles an herbaceous
                    plant.</p>

                  <h2>2. Introduce and encourage predators</h2>

                  <p><strong><strong>Slow worm</strong>s:
                    </strong>These beautiful creatures are becoming
                    rare and are strictly protected, so it is not a
                    good idea to pick them in the wild. The only way to
                    get them in your garden is to provide a good
                    shelter and hope they turn up. A sheet of
                    corrugated iron or black plastic in a slightly
                    raised and sunny spot near the compost heap seems
                    best. If you have them, protect them well – they
                    are a great ally!<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Hedgehogs: </strong>There is an issue
                    whether it is ethically justified to keep hedgehogs
                    in the perimeter of an allotment or garden but if
                    the hedgehog has a habitat able to provide it with
                    all the essentials it needs, I think it is. I
                    received hedgehogs from the <a href="http://www.hessilhead.org.uk/">Hessilhead
                    Wildlife Rescue Trust</a> and introduced them into
                    my garden. It is not a straightforward process as
                    they need to inspect your garden to determine
                    whether it is safe for hedgehogs – a road or
                    badgers nearby would give you a negative reply. But
                    if you are lucky enough to have a hedgehog, a hag
                    pile and some decent fencing to stop it going on
                    the road is important as protection. Make sure
                    there is enough food for it in the garden but
                    don’t leave out milk, or cat food (attracts
                    vermin), and don’t de-flea it as this would kill
                    it.</p>

                  <p><strong>Ducks:</strong> Experts recommend Khaki
                    Campbells or Indian Runners who are the best
                    carnivores – other breeds might eat more of your
                    vegetables. A good permaculture solution would be
                    to have your garden in between the duck hut and the
                    pen, thereby allowing the ducks a good munch in the
                    morning and evening while on the way to and from
                    home.</p>

                  <p><strong>Beetles:</strong> Carob beetles are very
                    effective slug predators – the larvae and beetles
                    eat the eggs and the tiny slugs. If you have these
                    beetles in your garden, you can help by providing a
                    good home for them; some patches between your beds
                    with tough grasses or sedges, straw or hay in an
                    upside down plastic box, stones to live under and
                    well drained soil are all good.</p>

                  <p><strong>Centipedes:</strong> These are carnivorous
                    nocturnal hunters. Learn to distinguish between the
                    millipedes and centipedes, as millipedes are
                    herbivores and love young seedlings. The centipedes
                    I know are harmless. Centipedes like it moist so
                    live in leaf litter, under stones, in rotting wood
                    etc. <br/>

                  <h2><strong>3. Control by distraction</strong> <br/>
                  </h2>

                  <p>There are plants out there that slugs like better
                    than your vegetables. If you grow them in your
                    garden they will attract the slugs and all you will
                    need to do is pick them up at dusk or put a slug
                    trap nearby. Lawn Camomile is my favourite because
                    it is most effective in spring when my seedlings
                    are small and most vulnerable. It is a perennial,
                    so when the annuals are at the most vulnerable, the
                    camomile is in full swing already. You should also
                    rub the plant as the scent released attracts slugs.
                    <br/>
                  </p>

                  <h2><strong>4. Control by death or relocation<br/>
                    </strong></h2>

                  <p>I used to catch slugs in a jar and relocation them
                    until I realised that, in essence, I was
                    transporting an imbalance from one ecosystem to
                    another. Now I kill them without mercy, but as
                    humanely as possible. The most effective way of
                    finding them is to go out with a torch just after
                    dusk or on a miserable grey wet day. Make sure to
                    look on the underside of the vegetable leaves and
                    let the plant damage and slime trails guide you.</p>

                  <p><strong>Jars:</strong> Drown slugs by putting them
                    in a jar filled completely with water and keeping
                    the lid screwed on tightly. A bucket with water is
                    not good enough, the slugs will just crawl out
                    again.</p>

                  <p><strong><strong>Sharp knife:</strong> </strong>My
                    preferred method at the moment is a sharp knife. I
                    use it flick the slugs of the plant onto the soil
                    surface and behead the poor things. I think it is
                    the quickest death, and the most convenient.</p>

                  <p><strong>Beer traps:</strong> After trying several
                    designs this is the winner. The slugs are attracted
                    by the fermentation gasses of beer. Any cheap lager
                    or homebrew is good, though ales and Guinness are
                    best. Place the traps at the edge of the beds. If
                    you place them in the middle, slugs might get
                    distracted by your juicy vegetables on the way to
                    the pub.</p>

                  <p><strong>Other traps:</strong> Grapefruit halves,
                    flower pots, cardboard, or anything dark and moist
                    will be favoured by the slugs as a hiding place
                    during the day. Inspect and capture at your
                    leisure.</p>

                  <p>I feed some slugs to my frog spawn – they even
                    fight for them – and I hope it helps them to
                    develop a taste for slugs when they are older.</p>

                  <h2>5. Border control</h2>

                  <p><strong>Copper:</strong> Slugs don’t like to
                    crawl over copper. A dozen or so pennies stuck into
                    the soil around a seedling can form a border – a
                    stripped electrical cable is even better. Cut the
                    top and the bottom of a plastic bottle. Wrap the
                    stripped cable a few times around it with one or
                    two loops in it, fasten it to the bottle with duct
                    tape through the loops and flatten the copper loops
                    to the plastic. Dig the plastic into the soil so
                    that slugs don’t crawl underneath. If you use
                    sticks to support the plant, wrap copper around the
                    sticks too. Make sure none of the leaves touch the
                    ground or any weeds touch the plant. Slugs can’t
                    fly but they know how to find shortcuts.</p>

                  <p><strong>Egg shells: </strong>The sharp edges of
                    eggshells help as a deterrent, but only when they
                    are clean and dry. When peeling an egg, try to
                    remove the inner membrane and rinse if needed. Be
                    aware that rain quickly makes the eggshells lose
                    their effectiveness.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Do not try:</strong></h2>

                  <p><strong>Salt: </strong>Pouring salt around your
                    veg will keep the slugs away indeed, but unless
                    your plants like maritime conditions they will die
                    too!</p>

                  <p><strong>Seashells:</strong> The sharp edges deter
                    slugs from crossing, but they don’t decay like
                    eggshells and can be a serious nuisance when
                    weeding for many years to come.</p>

                  <p><strong>Slug pellets:</strong> Most are not
                    organic and will kill the predators too. Even the
                    organic ones are not wise to use: when the slugs
                    die, the predators leave to find food elsewhere –
                    leaving you dependent on the pellets.</p>

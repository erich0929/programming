            will be two decades clean next month, and his guns-and-jail
            years lie almost as far behind him as the drugs. Yet the
            Texas-raised, Nashville-based protest singer gets no
            luckier in love: he's currently <a href="http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/2014/03/19/steve-earle-dan-condon/24582/" title="">separated from musician wife Alison Moorer</a> and
            faces a seventh divorce, which even in Nashville terms –
            where heartbreak is practically an industry – must be
            close to a record.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>With his perpetual troubles in mind, to watch the
            long-haired, silver-bearded 59-year-old play solo here
            before 2,000 people with just a twangy acoustic guitar,
            mandolin and harmonicas for company, spilling his soul,
            cracking jokes and even striking notes of wild optimism,
            proves a powerful experience.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>On a fair summer evening in Glasgow, this show represents
            the Kelvingrove Bandstand's first as an out-and-out music
            venue since its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/belle-and-sebastian-kelvingrove-bandstand-glasgow-review" title="">resurrection for the Commonwealth Games</a>, and
            it'll host few others so loaded with meaning.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>Break-up songs Now She's Gone, Goodbye ("same girl,
            different harmonica") and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf_jEKZ77So" title="">Every Part of Me</a>, tell of the bittersweet
            affairs of a man who falls deep and lands hard, much as
            their author gruffly brackets them less romantically. "That
            brings me through the chicks' part," Earle quips. "It
            prevents my audience from growing exponentially uglier and
            hairier."</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>The night and the subject matter darkens as South
            Nashville Blues remembers dragging rain-sodden streets
            seeking a fix – a bleak dirge which actually makes his
            life at that time "sound a lot more fucking fun than it
            was". A shift into Celtic-inflected folk and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/country" title="More             from the Guardian on Country">country</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lcnvd8BNFE" title="">Galway Girl</a> and Tom Ames' Prayer has couples
            spinning ramshackle hoedowns in the aisles.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>Even by typical standards of Americana's only "borderline
            Marxist" Earle ends with a bold and hopeful political
            statement. This Sunday, he explains, he'll sing tonight's
            peace-song closer <a href="https://www.youtube..com/watch?v=nU278yFdvgQ" title="">Jerusalem</a> among other numbers with his Jewish
            singer-songwriter friend David Broza at Masada in Israel,
            despite safety warnings to the contrary and the prevailing
            mood that reconciliation in the Middle East has rarely felt
            less likely. "I don't believe in lost causes," Earle
            affirms, stirringly. "Look at me!"</p>

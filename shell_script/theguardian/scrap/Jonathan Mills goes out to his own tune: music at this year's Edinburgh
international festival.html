                    Mills’s last season</a> as director of the
                    Edinburgh international festival, which opens on
                    Friday, brings some surprises and some resonant
                    coincidences in his final music programme. There
                    are just two staged operas – <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/troyens#.U-OM9oBdU0g">Berlioz’s
                    Trojans </a>with the Mariinsky Opera and Valery
                    Gergiev, Aldeburgh Music’s acclaimed production
                    of <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/owenwingrave">Britten’s
                    Owen Wingrave</a> – both of which speak to this
                    year’s festival’s themes of the profound
                    effects of conflict on art, whether through the
                    portrayal of epic warfare or the trauma of personal
                    conscience. And there’s also a concert
                    performance of <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/owenwingrave">Rossini’s
                    William Tell </a>with conductor Gianandrea Noseda
                    and his company of the Teatro Regio Turin.</p>

                    Philharmonic and Jiri Belohlavek</a>, bringing a
                    home-grown smorgasbord of their bread-and-butter
                    repertoire, and the <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/concertgebouw1">Concertgebouw
                    Orchestra and Mariss Jansons</a> in an only
                    slightly more adventurous but nonetheless staple
                    diet of Shostakovich, Ravel, Rihm, Brahms and

                    opening concert</a> on Friday is almost the pick of
                    the lot, as Oliver Knussen – born in Glasgow –
                    conducts the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in
                    Schoenberg’s Five Orchestral Pieces, Scriabin’s
                    Prometheus and Debussy’s Martyrdom of St
                    Sebastian; but there’s also <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/bachmass">Phillippe
                    Herreweghe</a> in Bach’s B Minor Mass and
                    Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms, as well as
                    Andrew Davis leading the Melbourne Symphony
                    Orchestra in Percy Grainger’s masterpiece of
                    creative imagination,<a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/mso#.U-ON5YBdU0g">

                  <p>Most intriguingly of all, and potentially bravely,
                    Jonathan Mills is going out with a musical bang of
                    his very own creation, with a performance of his
                    oratorio <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/bbcsso">Sandakan
                    Threnody</a> in the first half of the final
                    concert. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArOPcm_Tgxs">Talking
                    to Kate Molleson</a>, Mills described his decision
                    to include his own composition in his final
                    orchestral programme (in the second half, Ilan
                    Volkov conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra
                    in Janacek’s Glagolitic Mass): “I questioned
                    myself about whether or not I would include a piece
                    of my own. But I’ve been asked by a lot of people
                    in Edinburgh, OK, you’re a composer, so let’s
                    hear your music! <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“Sandakan Threnody is a lament, a putting to
                    rest of the souls of people that I never knew. But
                    my father was in that prison camp in north Borneo
                    [during the second world war, in which 2,500
                    British and Australian prisoners of war died].
                    It’s not actually a critique of the Japanese,
                    it’s much more personal. It’s a statement of
                    solidarity, of sadness, but of optimism as well for
                    those troops and their plight. It’s a threnody in
                    the truest Greek sense of the word, a grieving that
                    has to be a public act. You can’t shove things
                    under the carpet. We see that with great relevance
                    today – in Libya, or Syria; we need to bear
                    witness, we need to allow the voices of those who
                    havebeen silenced to be heard. So this was a moment
                    of deep personal emotion for me, which I was
                    offering to all of the people with whom my father
                    had suffered, before he died: to show that there
                    was somebody who was taking that circumstance
                    forward, simply using my skills – whether they
                    were good or not is irrelevant – at the disposal
                    of this particular moment.”</p>

                  <p>Sandakan Threnody obviously fits Mills’s themes
                    of artistic responses to war, and however modestly
                    he puts it in terms of his “skills”, it’s a
                    bold statement to make your (almost) last word as
                    the world’s most famous arts festival’s
                    director your own composition.</p>

                  <p>As well as the Usher Hall gigs, there’s another
                    season of variously exquisite and imaginative
                    chamber concerts at the Queen’s Hall running
                    throughout the three weeks, but my pick of the
                    whole music programme are the concerts at<a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/bbcsso">
                    Greyfriars</a>, starting with a truly stellar
                    line-up in Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time
                    on Monday 11th (piano: Steven Osborne, cello: Alban
                    Gerhardt, violin: Antje Weithaas, clarinet: Jörg
                    Widmann!), some magnificent vocal consorts, from
                    the Hilliard Ensemble to the Polish Radio Choir and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhW4udTlLM">Sister
                    Marie Keyrouz’s L’Ensemble de la Paix</a>, and
                    instrumental groups from the centuries-traversing
                    programme of the <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/arditti#.U-OMroBdU0g">Arditti
                    Quartet</a>, with countertenor Jake Arditti, to
                    Concerto Italiano’s Monteverdi. If you’re lucky
                    enough to be in Edinburgh over the next 22 days –
                    enjoy!<br/>

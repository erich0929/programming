                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Celtic have been reinstated to the Champions
                    League after Legia Warsaw were punished by Uefa for
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/07/celtic-champions-league-reprieve-legia-warsaw-ineligible" title="">fielding an ineligible player</a>.</p>

                  <p>Legia won the third qualifying-round tie 6-1 on
                    aggregate but brought on Bartosz Bereszynski for
                    the last four minutes of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/06/celtic-legia-warsaw-champions-league-match-report" title="">their 2-0 second-leg victory at
                    Murrayfield</a>, while he was supposed to be
                    serving a suspension following a red card for
                    violent conduct in last season’s Europa League.</p>

                  <p>Uefa on Friday punished the Polish club by
                    awarding the game 3-0 to Celtic, meaning the
                    Scottish champions progressed on away goals having
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/30/legia-warsaw-celtic-champions-league-qualifier-first-leg-report" title="">lost the first match in Warsaw 4-1</a> –
                    a game in which Ivica Vrdoljak missed two
                    penalties.</p>

                  <p>Celtic will now play Maribor of Slovenia <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/08/arsenal-draw-besiktas-champions-league-qualifier" title="">in the final qualifying round</a>.</p>

                  <p>Ronny Deila admitted he has sympathy for Legia
                    Warsaw after his side’s dramatic reinstatement.
                    Speaking at the club’s Lennoxtown training
                    complex, Celtic’s new manager said: “It is very
                    strange, I have to say that. First of all I feel
                    very sorry for Legia, and my friends from Norway
                    there.</p>

                  <p>“It is tough to think of that and now we are in
                    the Champions League. That is what Uefa said, we
                    haven’t been involved in anything. I am a
                    football manager and I have to go with it and now
                    we are preparing for Maribor.”</p>

                  <p>Uefa’s statement on Friday morning read:
                    “Legia have been sanctioned for fielding an
                    ineligible player (article 18 of the Uefa Champions
                    League regulations and article 21 of the
                    disciplinary regulations). The match has been
                    declared as forfeit meaning Legia Warsaw have lost
                    the match 3-0. As a consequence, Celtic have
                    qualified for the Champions League play-offs on
                    away goals (agg: 4-4) and Legia will compete in the
                    Europa League play-offs.</p>

                  <p>“In addition the player Bartosz Bereszynski has
                    been suspended for one additional Uefa competition
                    match for which he would be otherwise eligible.
                    This suspension shall be added to the remaining two
                    match suspension which the player still has to
                    serve in accordance with the control and
                    disciplinary body decision of 13 February 2014.”</p>

                  <p>Bereszynski was sent off against Apollon in the
                    final match of Legia’s Europa League campaign
                    last season, earning a three-match suspension. He
                    missed both legs of Legia’s tie against St
                    Patrick’s in the second qualifying round and also
                    sat out the 4-1 first-leg victory over Celtic.
                    However, it has emerged that Bereszynski had not
                    been registered in Legia’s squad for the second
                    qualifying round, and so the matches did not count
                    towards his suspension.</p>

                  <p>Legia Warsaw have five days in which to lodge an
                    appeal, and a statement on the Polish’s club
                    website indicated they had requested Uefa’s
                    reasoning for the ruling before making a decision.</p>

                  <p>Celtic benefited from an ineligibility ruling
                    during the 2011-12 season when they <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/02/celtic-europa-league-fc-sion" title="">were reinstated into the Europa League
                    group stages despite a qualifying defeat by
                    Sion</a>. The Swiss side were ruled to have fielded
                    five ineligible players after breaching a Fifa
                    transfer ban and failed to reverse the decision
                    during a lengthy legal battle.</p>

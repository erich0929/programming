                  <p>Associated Press= AMSTERDAM (AP) â
                    Twenty-three victims aboard Malaysia Airlines
                    Flight 17 have been identified so far, the
                    Dutch-led forensic team working on their remains
                    said Friday.</p>

                  <p>Those identified include 18 Dutch, two Malaysians,
                    a Canadian, a German and a Briton, Justice Ministry
                    spokesman Jean Fransman said. All their families
                    have been notified.</p>

                  <p>Flight 17 was shot down July 17 over eastern
                    Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. Pro-Russian rebels
                    have publicly denied downing the plane but one top
                    rebel has told The Associated Press that the
                    insurgents were involved.</p>

                  <p>The head of the Dutch forensic team working at a
                    military compound in the Dutch city of Hilversum
                    described the challenges his team is facing. Arie
                    de Bruyn told reporters Friday that 228 coffins had
                    been sent to the Netherlands but they "sometimes
                    contained remains of more than one or two people."</p>

                  <p>De Bruyn said remains have been sorted into 703
                    groups.</p>

                  <p>"As you can see right away, that's many more than
                    the victims who were on the plane," he said.</p>

                  <p>Around 176 bodies are more or less intact, leaving
                    527 sets of partial remains, he said.</p>

                  <p>The dental records and fingerprints of victims
                    have been gathered and DNA profiles are being
                    assembled in a process expected to take months.</p>

                  <p>"Whenever there's an identification, even if it's
                    so difficult to tell families that it's only a part
                    of a body, we'll still tell them," he vowed.</p>

                  <p>On Wednesday the Netherlands' prime minister
                    called off further attempts to recover remains from
                    the crash area, citing danger to the recovery
                    workers from nearby fighting between the rebels and
                    Ukrainian forces.</p>

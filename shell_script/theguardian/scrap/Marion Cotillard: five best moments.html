                  <p>Marion Cotillard’s career is one to be marvelled
                    at. Ever since La Vie en Rose, she has won an
                    impressive number of awards for her lead roles in
                    French and American films, performing in French,
                    English and even Polish (The Immigrant, 2013). She
                    has been involved in films set in the past, the
                    present, and even in dreams, playing a range of
                    complex characters. In anticipation of her latest
                    film, Two Days, One Night, which is out in cinemas
                    this month, we took on the challenging task of
                    picking out her Top 5 moments. What do you think?

                  <h2><strong>La Vie en Rose (2007)</strong></h2>

                  <p>Olivier Dahan said that he chose Cotillard to
                    portray the French singer Edith Piaf in the biopic
                    La Vie en Rose before he had even met her, because
                    he noticed a similarity between Piaf’s and
                    Cotillard’s eyes. It was her breakthrough role
                    which gave her international recognition as well as
                    a cabinet full of awards, including a BAFTA, a
                    Golden Globe, and Oscar. Every one of them well
                    deserved for her realisation of the international
                    icon, showing Piaf to be deeply complex, troubled
                    and strong woman.<em><br/>

                  <h2><strong>Nine (2009)</strong></h2>

                  <p>Cotillard played Luisa Conti, the frustrated wife
                    of film director Guido Conti (Daniel-Day Lewis) in
                    the film adaptation of the musical Nine. Time
                    magazine ranked her portrayal of Conti as the fifth
                    best female performance in 2009 and she was
                    nominated for a Golden Globe. Here we see how
                    Cotillard pulled her weight against Daniel-Day
                    Lewis in a scene where Luisa confronts Guido about
                    an affair.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Public Enemies (2009)</strong></h2>

                  <p>Also in 2009, Cotillard beat competition from a
                    long list of American actresses to play John
                    Dillinger’s (Johnny Depp) lover, Billie
                    Frechette, in Michael Mann’s period gangster
                    movie. Her role was one of the larger female roles
                    in an American crime movie and Cotillard’s
                    rounded performance made her a character that the
                    audience warmed to.<br/>

                  <h2><strong>Inception (2010)</strong></h2>

                  <p>Christopher Nolan’s Inception is one of the
                    biggest blockbusters that Cotillard has been
                    involved in. She played Mal Cobb – Dom Cobb’s
                    dead wife – alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and
                    Joseph Gorgon-Levitt, and the film made $825
                    million at the global box-office. She brought Cobb
                    to life, making her an intriguing character that
                    haunted me long after watching the film.<br/>

                  <h2><strong>Rust and Bone (2012)</strong></h2>

                  <p>Cotillard starred alongside Matthias Schoenaerts
                    in Jaques Audiard’s Rust and Bone in 2012. Her
                    performance as Stéphanie, a killer whale trainer
                    who suffers a terrible accident. This powerful
                    scene shows the moment when Stéphanie wakes to
                    find herself in the hospital and is absolutely
                    heart-wrenching –&nbsp;arguably one of
                    Cotillard’s most powerful cinematic
                    moments.<br/>

<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company at the centre
                of the row over <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" title="More from the Guardian on Cancer">cancer</a>
                drugs pricing, played a significant part in the genesis
                of the Cancer Drugs Fund, set up in 2010 to pay for
                drugs that were too expensive for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" title="More from the Guardian on NHS">NHS</a> approval.
                Four years on the company has become the fund's largest
                beneficiary.</p>

              <p>The existence of the fund leads to some confusing
                results. Kadcyla, the £90,000 advanced <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/breast-cancer" title="More from the Guardian on Breast cancer">breast
                cancer</a> drug, was rejected on Friday by Nice, the
                National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, on
                cost grounds for general NHS use. But Roche is already
                being reimbursed from the £600m fund.</p>

              <p>A number of other Roche drugs have also been turned
                down by Nice because of their high cost. The drug that
                cancer doctors most frequently ask the fund to pay for
                is Roche's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/24/avastin-too-expensive-for-patients" title="">Avastin</a>, rejected for both breast and
                bowel cancer, which accounts for a quarter of requests.</p>

              <p>The fund was a politically expedient creation. It
                provided a way for any government to take the sting out
                of tabloid stories that cancer patients were being
                denied what are always described as "life-saving"
                drugs, although invariably they are not – at best
                they extend lives by usually a matter of months.</p>

              <p>Key to its establishment was an inquiry, commissioned
                by the Labour government just before the 2010 election,
                into spending on drugs in the UK and other countries.
                Cancer tsar Sir Mike Richards jointly chaired the
                inquiry with John Melville, then head of Roche Products
                in the UK.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extent-and-causes-of-international-variations-in-drug-usage" title="">Their report </a>found that UK spending on
                cancer drugs was lower than in comparable western
                countries. It was written by Mike Birtwistle, a
                lobbyist working for the consultancy MHP Health Mandate
                at the time, which numbered Roche among its clients.</p>

              <p>Roche's spokesman said Melville had been invited to
                chair the inquiry into variations in drug use "in part
                due to our track record on using data to highlight
                variations in access to care". Editorial control firmly
                rested with the report's steering group and ultimately
                the Department of Health, it added.</p>

              <p>Birtwistle said he was asked by Professor Richards to
                draft the report because of capacity constraints at the
                Department of Health. "This was supported by Roche as
                part of MHP's ongoing consultancy work for them and was
                part of John Melville's contribution to delivering the
                project," he said, adding that other organisations were
                also involved, including Nice.</p>

              <p>Another client of MHP Health Mandate was the Rarer
                Cancers Foundation, a patient group that took the lead
                in campaigning and featured prominently in newspaper
                stories about cancer sufferers who were denied drugs.
                <a href="http://www.rarercancers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=120&amp;Itemid=135" title="">In 2008, the Foundation published a report on
                access to cancer drugs around the country</a>, written
                by Birtwistle and his colleague Bill Morgan, who went
                on to become health secretary <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrewlansley" title="More from the Guardian on Andrew Lansley">Andrew
                Lansley</a>'s special adviser after the election and
                then returned to lobbying work with Morgan when Lansley
                lost his job.</p>

              <p>Its claims that cancer patients were being denied
                life-saving drugs were widely reported. This report was
                entirely funded by Roche – although later reports on
                the same theme were sponsored by multiple companies.
                Roche said, while it funded the Rarer Cancer
                Foundation's report, editorial control rested entirely
                with the charity.</p>

              <p>But the fund today is increasingly recognised as a
                problem. It is over-spent and unsustainable and does
                not have the backing of the pharmaceutical industry as
                a whole, which now generally accepts the need for some
                price restraint and Nice's expert assessments. At a
                time when the NHS is under huge financial pressure,
                Roche is increasingly seen as out of step.</p>

              <p>The Swiss pharma company is not a member of the
                Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
                (ABPI), the trade body. It was suspended from
                membership for six months in 2008 over a serious breach
                of the rules, involving supplying slimming clinics with
                its prescription-only drug Xenical. The company chose
                not to rejoin.</p>

              <p>Asked why, it implies that cancer is a special case.
                "As one of the leading pharmaceutical developers of
                cancer medicines, our focus is on improving outcomes in
                cancer. This is not an area of focus for the ABPI, so
                this, along with our commercial reasons, is why we have
                chosen not to rejoin," said a spokesman. He said it
                continues to abide by the industry's code of practice.</p>

              <p>The ABPI negotiates payments for medicines with the
                government and has recently agreed a deal that caps the
                NHS drugs bill at between £11bn and £12bn a year. The
                industry must reimburse the NHS if the bill rises
                higher. That means that the soaring cost of drugs paid
                for through the Cancer Drugs Fund may well end up with
                the rest of the industry having to foot the bill for
                Roche's high prices.</p>

              <p>Stephen Whitehead, the ABPI's chief executive, said
                the body did not support the setting-up of the Cancer
                Drugs Fund. The member companies have embarked on a
                new, partnership approach to pricing, which needs
                "close collaboration with all interested groups
                including Nice, patient organisations, the NHS and the
                government", he said. For the first time, industry has
                "skin in the game" when it comes to the assessments of
                the value of new drugs, because they stand to lose if
                the ceiling on the drugs bill is breached.</p>

              <p>"We have put in place partnership agreements with the
                NHS and Nice and it is absolutely in the interests of
                all the industry that we establish appropriate prices
                for medicines to ensure that there is a level playing
                field, otherwise you will have some parts of the
                industry underwriting other parts that are not
                undergoing effective value assessment," said Whitehead.</p>

              <p>"The industry and the NHS needs effective and
                pro-innovative value assessment for new medicines.
                Partnership, not confrontation, is very clearly the way
                forward and this is recognised fully by the ABPI
                membership, given our shared interest in managing the
                medicines bill in the UK."</p>

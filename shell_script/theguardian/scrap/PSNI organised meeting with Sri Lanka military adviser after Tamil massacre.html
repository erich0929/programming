                between British officials and a Sri Lankan military
                adviser a month after the massacre of tens of thousands
                of Tamil civilians in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/srilanka" title="More from the Guardian on Sri Lanka">Sri
                Lanka</a>, it has emerged â€“ but no minutes were taken
                about what was discussed.</p>

              <p>The Northern Ireland Policing Board, which scrutinises
                the running of the Police Service of Northern Ireland,
                has confirmed that it arranged the talks between the
                Foreign Office and the Sri Lankan defence forces
                representative with a view to the PSNI becoming
                "critical friends" of the country's security forces.</p>

              <p>Government lawyers have confirmed in a freedom of
                information request that no minutes exist of the
                meeting at the policing board headquarters in Belfast
                on 18 June 2009, shortly after Sri Lanka's military
                allegedly killed tens of thousands of people in a final
                offensive against the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/tamil-tigers" title="More from the Guardian on Tamil Tigers">Tamil
                Tigers</a>.</p>

              <p>Researcher Phil Miller, from the pressure group
                Corporate Watch, who submitted the FOI request, told
                the Guardian: "We are being kept in the dark about what
                went on at this Belfast meeting. Did Britain raise any
                concerns about Sri Lanka's massacres of Tamils before
                it let the PSNI continue its role as 'critical friends'
                with Colombo?"</p>

              <p>The FCO says the only information it holds on the 2009
                meeting is a single sentence, noting that its official
                agreed in advance for the PSNI to offer further
                assistance to Sri Lanka. The PSNI officers continued to
                work with Sri Lanka, even after the UN concluded that
                at least 70,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the
                final months of the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of
                survivors were then interned in camps.</p>

              <p>One of the PSNI officers called to give advice to the
                Sri Lankans was the assistant chief constable, Duncan
                McCausland. He had previously co-written a report for
                the Americans in Iraq, advocating the creation of
                Belfast-style "peace walls" to separate rival sectarian
                communities in Baghdad.</p>

              <p>A policing board spokesman said countless overseas
                delegations travelled to Belfast to discuss
                police-related issues with the PSNI. "The board
                regularly received visits and delegations from across
                the world to share the experiences of policing change
                in Northern Ireland and lessons learnt in terms of
                independent oversight and accountability for the PSNI.</p>

              <p>"The meeting on 18 June 2009 was reported to the
                policing board meeting on 2 July 2009 as part of
                chairman's business and the minutes are published on
                the board's website. Such visits received a standard
                presentation, which covers the roles and
                responsibilities of the board as the accountability
                authority of the PSNI, and as such minutes are not
                considered a necessity."</p>

              <p>Yasmine Ahmed, from Rights Watch UK, said: "The
                British public has a right to know the nature and
                extent of UK government cooperation with and support to
                the Sri Lankan government during a period of brutal
                violence and severe <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights" title="More from the Guardian on Human rights">human
                rights</a> abuses against the Tamil population.</p>

              <p>"Any information about this meeting must be disclosed
                so that the public can be assured of the nature of the
                involvement of UK police forces. It is inconceivable
                that no records were kept of the contents of this
                meeting and we call on the government to disclose such
                information."</p>

              <p>Last weekend it emerged that 3,500 Sri Lankan police
                officers, including some senior commanders, had
                received training from the Scottish Police College
                (SPC) since 2007.</p>

              <p>Policing in Northern Ireland through the Troubles,
                particularly towards its endgame in the late 1980s and
                early 1990s, is studied as a template for
                counter-insurgency methods across the world. Following
                the invasion of Iraq in 2003 a number of former senior
                Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were recruited to
                advise the post-Saddam government on how to police
                divided communities and build up an intelligence system
                to counter terrorism.</p>

              <p>RUC Special Branch veterans and other senior
                commanders were paid handsomely not only for advising
                the Iraqi government about how to police the Sunni-Shia
                communal schism on the streets but also on methods of
                agent recruitment within insurgent groups.</p>

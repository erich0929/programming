                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Yesterday, Barack Obama claimed his humanitarian
                    conscience had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/obama-authorises-iraq-air-strikes-against-isis" title="">moved him to intervene</a> in northern
                    Iraq to protect civilians from harm. It is not
                    difficult to spot the hypocrisy or doubt the
                    sincerity of the motives at work, especially given
                    recent <a href="http://blog.amnestyusa.org/uncategorized/the-united-states-is-not-just-a-bystander-in-israel-gaza-violence/" title="">atrocities committed by Washington’s
                    main regional ally</a> with US-supplied arms and
                    ammunition. Equally, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/27/iraq.iraq5" title="">given recent experience</a>, one might
                    question whether the US military itself can be
                    trusted to have due regard for civilian life. But
                    some urgent questions still need to be asked. What
                    is going to happen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdIEm1s6yhY" title="">thousands of Yazidis besieged on Mount
                    Sinjar</a> by the bloodthirsty fanatics of Islamic
                    State, or to the ancient Christian communities
                    being <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28397528" title="">systematically driven out of their
                    homes</a>?</p>

                  <p>What is to become of the Kurdish capital, Erbil,
                    now potentially in the crosshairs of jihadi forces?
                    And what of Iraq, Syria and the wider region, now
                    that Islamic State has consolidated its power and
                    shown that i<a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n16/patrick-cockburn/isis-consolidates" title="">t may be very far from a flash in the
                    pan</a>?</p>

                  <p>It is clear that humanitarian air drops are needed
                    as a matter of urgency in northern Iraq, and these
                    are to be welcomed. The prospect of US air strikes,
                    however, is concerning – for two main reasons.
                    First, as shown by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all" title="">Obama’s drone-led extrajudicial
                    execution programme</a>, there are bound to be
                    civilian casualties. Second, as things stand, any
                    air strikes will, de facto, be carried out on
                    behalf of Nouri al-Maliki’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/15/nouri-al-maliki-is-he-the-man-to-blame-in-iraq" title="">widely despised sectarian government</a>.</p>

                  <p>There is a real danger, therefore, that air
                    strikes could inflame the situation further,
                    entrenching alienation among Sunni Arabs and
                    driving more people into the arms of Islamic State.
                    Any credible call for military action needs to show
                    it has weighed these risks in the balance. A
                    genuine humanitarian intervention would not be one
                    that made the situation even more dangerous and
                    life-threatening than it already is.</p>

                  <p>The symptoms of the crisis should be treated
                    carefully but above all, its roots must be
                    substantively addressed. A national unity
                    government in Baghdad, based on the recent election
                    results, which can credibly reach out to all
                    communities with a new grand bargain – thus
                    isolating Islamic State from those who may have
                    sided with it out of desperate exasperation with
                    Maliki – is urgently required. Time is fast
                    running out. It beggars belief that Iraq lost a
                    quarter of its territory two months ago and the
                    political class in Baghdad still hasn’t got its
                    act together. External <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-crisis-russian-fighter-jets-arrive-to-hold-back-isis-approach-9571086.html" title="">support for the Maliki regime</a>, not
                    only from the US but also from Russia and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/03/us-iraq-security-iran-insight-idUSKBN0G30GE20140803" title="">especially Iran</a>, make it less likely
                    that the necessary political change will come.</p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>In the end, Islamic State will have to be defeated
                    militarily but this can only be done by Iraqis
                    themselves, on behalf of a credible national unity
                    government. War waged by cynically self-interested
                    foreign forces allied to a narrowly sectarian
                    regime will exacerbate precisely the dynamics that
                    created this situation to begin with. That, after
                    all, is a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/19/opinion/iraq-neocons-wearing/index.html" title="">major lesson</a> of the post-2003 US-led
                    occupation.</p>

          <p>If you're not white, how should you address race in your
            <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy" title="More from the Guardian on Comedy">comedy</a>? At a
            festival where two acts of East Asian origin have titled
            their shows <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/phil-wang-mellow-yellow" title="">Mellow Yellow</a> and <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/rick-kiesewetter-no-more-mr-rice-guy" title="">No More Mr Rice Guy</a>, you might think
            self-mockery was the way to go. <a href="https://twitter.com/MrNishKumar" title="">Nish
            Kumar</a> has been advised to try that, or, by contrast, to
            avoid the subject altogether. He's concluded that there's
            such a thing as "correct race comedy" – cue
            near-the-knuckle caricature of standup of Indian origin
            making like Bollywood – and that what he's doing isn't
            it.</p>

          <p>But if Kumar won't pander to our stereotypes, he doesn't
            stint on making us laugh – and making us think. As you'd
            guess from the tongue-in-cheek title, his new set
            Ruminations on the Nature of Subjectivity, showcases an
            anxious, overthinking comic with much to say about race,
            the brittle foundations of his ego and the internet's
            corrosive effect on our concentration.</p>

          <p>Kumar doesn't hang around: there's lots in this show, and
            he clips through it, powered by exaggerated frustration
            that his life, and the world, aren't turning out as
            expected. The first section turns on unsolicited counsel he
            once received to be more aggressive to white audiences.
            This leads to a discussion of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/britons-uncomfortable-ethnic-minority-pm" title="">a recent poll</a> that revealed some glaring –
            and, in Kumar's treatment, droll – contradictions in
            white British attitudes to multiculturalism. To sum up:
            brown offspring, good; brown prime minister, not so sure.</p>

          <p>Even sharper is the section in which Kumar confronts his
            own egoism, pessimism and neuroses. You get the measure of
            how fretful he is from the skit about trying to use reverse
            psychology to fall asleep; and how egotistical from his
            account of once admiring his own conversation so much that
            he forgot what he was talking about. It's a tight, smart
            set from a comic who confesses self-absorption while
            engaging expansively with the way we live now.</p>

          <p>• Until 24 August. Box office: 0131-226 0000. Venue: <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nish-kumar-ruminations-on-the-nature-of-subjectivity" title="">Pleasance Courtyard</a>, Edinburgh.</p>

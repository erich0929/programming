                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Manuel Pellegrini has stressed that he believes
                    Manchester City’s summer deals for Frank Lampard
                    and Bacary Sagna were conducted correctly in
                    response to recent comments from Arsène Wenger.</p>

                  <p>Over the last few days Wenger, whose Arsenal side
                    play City at Wembley on Sunday in the Community
                    Shield, has questioned both signings.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/06/manchester-city-frank-lampard-loan-new-york-chelsea" title="">Lampard has headed to the Etihad Stadium
                    on loan</a> until January from New York City FC –
                    Manchester City’s American sister outfit, who the
                    36-year-old England international signed for
                    earlier this summer.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/16/manchester-city-fine-transfer-cap-uefa-ffp" title="">The Premier League champions were hit with
                    sanctions from Uefa</a> for breaching financial
                    fair play rules in May, and when asked about the
                    Lampard deal, Wenger said: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/03/arsenal-monaco-friendly-match-report" title="">“Is it a way to get around the
                    fair-play? I don’t know.”</a> The Frenchman has
                    also subsequently suggested that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/bacary-sagna-manchester-city-arsenal-three-year-deal" title="">Sagna’s move to City this summer</a>
                    after his Arsenal contract finished was “agreed a
                    long time ago”.</p>

                  <p>However, asked on Friday if he was happy that
                    everything as far as the Lampard and Sagna deals
                    had been done correctly, Pellegrini said: “I
                    think so.”</p>

                  <p>The Chilean added that he was “surprised” by
                    Wenger’s comments, adding: “I think as managers
                    we have enough problems with our own teams to be
                    talking about other teams.</p>

                  <p>“The only thing I can say is that we have
                    important restrictions about the amount of money we
                    can spend, and Frank Lampard was a free player –
                    we didn’t spend any money in bringing him from
                    New York City to Manchester City.”</p>

                  <p>Pellegrini is baffled by any negative reaction
                    there has been to Lampard’s move, including from
                    Chelsea fans upset to see him at a Premier League
                    rival after 13 years at Stamford Bridge. “I
                    don’t understand the reaction of Chelsea fans who
                    say he is a traitor,” Pellegrini said.</p>

                  <p>“The problem was not that Frank Lampard did not
                    want to sign another contract with Chelsea –
                    Chelsea didn’t want him any more. He is a
                    competitive player, he will be important for our
                    team and we didn’t spend any money on him, so the
                    rules of financial fair play don’t have any
                    relation with Lampard.”</p>

                  <p>City will be without eight players for Sunday’s
                    match against Arsenal at Wembley. Lampard is deemed
                    not ready to feature yet following his arrival on
                    loan, and the same applies to fellow new signing
                    Bacary Sagna, along with Sergio Agüero, Pablo
                    Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho and the
                    captain Vincent Kompany – six City players who
                    were involved in the knockout stages of the World
                    Cup.</p>

                  <p>Alvaro Negredo is the other man to miss out due to
                    his foot injury, but there could be debuts for two
                    new recruits in the goalkeeper Willy Caballero and
                    the midfielder Fernando.</p>

                  <p><strong>Provisional Manchester City squad:
                    </strong>Hart, Caballero, Wright, Boyata, Clichy,
                    Rekik, Kolarov, Nastasic, Richards, Fernando,
                    García , Milner, Nasri, Navas, Silva, Sinclair,
                    Touré, Dzeko, Guidetti, Jovetic.</p>

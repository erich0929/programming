                  <p> GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) â Florida's attorney
                    general is asking state courts to stop considering
                    same-sex marriage cases until the U.S. Supreme
                    Court decides whether states have the right to ban
                    gay marriage.</p>

                  <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi filed two motions on
                    Friday in a state appeals court, requesting a
                    freeze on appeals of cases concerning the state's
                    constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
                    Voters approved the amendment in 2008.</p>

                  <p>Judges in four Florida counties have overturned
                    the ban, but no marriage licenses are being issued
                    because Bondi has appealed each case.</p>

                  <p>Bondi says the state will defer to the Supreme
                    Court and that any further state proceedings are a
                    waste of judicial resources. Utah and Oklahoma this
                    week asked the Supreme Court to decide the issue.</p>

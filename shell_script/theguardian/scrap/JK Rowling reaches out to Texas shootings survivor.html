                  <p> HOUSTON (AP) â The teenage survivor of a
                    shooting rampage that claimed the lives of her
                    parents and four siblings at their suburban Houston
                    home has drawn the attention of Harry Potter
                    creator J.K. Rowling.</p>

                  <p>Rowling's publicist says the British author sent
                    Cassidy Stay a letter and package.</p>

                  <p>Publicist Rebecca Salt isn't describing the
                    contents, saying the package is private.</p>

                  <p>Speaking at a public gathering days after the
                    shootings last month, the 15-year-old girl
                    paraphrased a quote by Albus Dumbledore, headmaster
                    of the Hogwarts school of wizards from the Harry
                    Potter books. Stay said: "Happiness can be found
                    even in darkest of times, if one remembers to turn
                    on the light."</p>

                  <p>Stay survived a head wound by playing dead. Her
                    aunt's ex-husband, Ronald Lee Haskell, faces
                    multiple capital murder charges in the shootings.</p>

                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>An Indonesian family claims to have found their
                    missing daughter a full decade after she was swept
                    away as a toddler by the 2004 tsunami and presumed
                    dead.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“It’s a miracle from God,” mother Jamaliah,
                    42, told the Jakarta Globe. “When I saw her, my
                    heart was beating really fast … We couldn’t
                    hold back our tears.”<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Fleeing huge waves as the tsunami pummelled their
                    village in West Aceh on 26 December 2004, Jamaliah
                    said she and her husband, Septi Rangkuti, 52, ran
                    for safety but couldn’t escape the water. Her
                    husband found a large wooden board and put the two
                    youngest children on top of it — daughter
                    Raudhatul Jannah, then 4, and her brother Arif
                    Pratama Rangkuti, 7.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Septi was separated from his children in the
                    mayhem and the parents spent a month looking for
                    them after the tsunami receded, with no leads and,
                    eventually, no hope. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>More than 170,000 people in Aceh, and tens of
                    thousands of others in other countries around the
                    Indian Ocean, were killed by the Boxing Day
                    tragedy.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The couple moved house with their one surviving
                    son and carried on with their lives, expecting to
                    never find their missing children — until in June
                    Jamaliah’s brother spotted a girl who looked like
                    missing daughter Raudhatul.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>He asked local villagers about the girl and
                    discovered that she had been orphaned by the
                    tsunami. Swept from Aceh all the way out to a
                    remote island south-west of the province, she was
                    rescued by a local fisherman and taken back to the
                    fisherman’s house, where he spent the last decade
                    raising her as “Wenni” with his ageing
                    mother.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“It’s a miracle from God,” Jamaliah told the
                    paper, describing how she and her husband visited
                    the girl in late June to confirm the rumour.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“The girl’s face resembles mine,” she added,
                    claiming that she was willing to take a DNA test to
                    confirm the girl’s identity. “Maybe because
                    there was a strong connection, when I hugged her,
                    she hugged me back and felt very comfortable in my
                    embrace.”</p>

                  <p>Daughter Raudhatul returned home to live in West
                    Aceh with her parents on Wednesday. After 10 years
                    living apart, mother Jamaliah said she is building
                    a strong relationship with the girl’s foster
                    parents, who are very happy that she found her
                    “supposed birth parents”.</p>

                  <p>But the arrival of Raudhatul may bring even more
                    good news. The girl, now 14, says that she and her
                    older brother Arif, who is still missing, both
                    survived the tsunami and ended up together on
                    Banyak Island. But the girl was taken away by one
                    fisherman, and the brother by another man, leading
                    the parents to believe their son – also presumed
                    dead for the past decade – may be out there
                    too.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“My instinct tells me he’s still alive,” she
                    says of her son. “We’ll go there soon to find
                    [him].”</p>

              <p>An influential Communist party journal has compared
                online rumours to Cultural Revolution-style
                denunciations and warned of the need to curb "wanton
                defamation" of authority, as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china" title="More from the Guardian on China">China</a>
                intensifies its campaign to control <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media" title="More from the Guardian on Social media">social
                media</a>.</p>

              <p>It came as the Chinese state broadcaster aired video
                footage of the handcuffed businessman Xue Manzi, also
                known as Charles Xue, confessing that he had
                irresponsibly spread rumours because his 12 million
                microblog followers <a href="http://news.163.com/13/0915/00/98P8QHIO00014JB5.htm" title="">made him feel like an "emperor"</a>.</p>

              <p>While China has repeatedly attempted to rein in the
                country's boisterous social media, a leading <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet" title="More from the Guardian on Internet">internet</a>
                activist described the wide-ranging crackdown on
                dissent as unprecedented.</p>

              <p>"In their eyes, the internet is out of control now and
                it has become a tool to reduce their political base,
                and subvert the ideology of the government," said Wen
                Yunchao. "This campaign includes the crackdown on 'big
                Vs' [verified microblog users with many followers] and
                inner rectification [of the Communist party]. It is a
                brutal and astute plan&nbsp;… At present, people do
                not talk."</p>

              <p>Others have raised concerns about increased pressure
                on academia and the detention of activists, including
                legal scholar Xu Zhiyong.</p>

              <p>The Communist party's top theoretical journal –
                Qiushi, or Seeking Truth – warned that some were
                using internet freedoms "to engage in wanton
                defamation, attacking the party and the
                government&nbsp;…The internet is full of all kinds of
                negative news and critical voices saying the government
                only does bad things and everything it says is wrong."</p>

              <p>It compared online rumours to "big character posters",
                the handwritten denunciations of people and
                institutions mostly associated with the Cultural
                Revolution, which began in 1966. The appearance of the
                posters was often the prelude to more vicious
                persecution.</p>

              <p>Websites and social media have become an essential
                forum for discussion and the spread of information,
                despite censorship, because the restrictions on other
                media are still stricter.</p>

              <p>But authorities have signalled they are increasing
                controls and targeting popular users by issuing a
                judicial decision that internet users could face three
                years in jail if they share rumours that are viewed
                more than 5,000 times or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/china-social-media-jail-rumours" title="">forwarded more than 500 times</a>.</p>

              <p>Chen Ziming, an independent Beijing-based scholar,
                said that normally in China one spoke of "killing
                chickens to scare the monkeys" – sending a warning to
                people by punishing lowlier folk.</p>

              <p>"This time they have killed a few monkeys, such as Xue
                Manzi, to try to terrify the chickens," he said.</p>

              <p>Police arrested Xue last month for soliciting
                prostitutes for group sex, but supporters believed it
                was retaliation for his outspokenness.</p>

              <p>On Saturday, the English-language edition of the
                state-run Global Times newspaper accused critics of
                seeking to portray any liberals who faced court as
                victims of "political persecution", adding: "Even the
                prostitution scandal of Chinese-American investor
                Charles Xue has been seen by them as an 'official
                crackdown on freedom of speech'."</p>

              <p>Only one day later Xue appeared – of his own
                volition, news anchors announced – on a major news
                bulletin, to talk about online responsibility. He told
                viewers: "Freedom of speech cannot override the law."</p>

              <p>The news programme cut between pictures of the venture
                capitalist in happier times, beaming from a magazine
                cover, and the image of him in handcuffs and a green
                detainee's uniform, with a scruffy beard and unkempt
                hair.</p>

              <p>Last week, another prominent businessman known for his
                bold online comments – property tycoon Pan Shiyi –
                appeared on television news to stress that internet
                users should be socially responsible. Viewers were as
                struck by the normally fluent entrepreneur's marked
                stutter as his remarks, and he <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/09/12/f-f-fear-and-loathing-on-the-chinese-internet/" title="">subsequently commented on his nervousness
                about the interview</a>.</p>

              <p>Zhang Lifan, a well-known historian, predicted that
                controls, while effective in the short term, risked
                backfiring as authorities lost touch with public
                opinion.</p>

              <p>"If someone is speaking, a certain security remains;
                if everyone remains silent, then when the volcano
                erupts, no one can control it. This is what the rulers
                don't understand. They force the critics to be
                opponents," he said.</p>

              <p>Wu Qiang, a political scientist at Tsinghua
                University, said the tightening of controls on civil
                society began before Xi Jinping became leader, under Hu
                Jintao and Wen Jiabao.</p>

              <p>But he added: "The government has a strong sense of
                insecurity because they see <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/multi-millionaire-investor-detained-china-crackdown-activists" title="">Xu Zhiyong and Wang Gongquan</a>, mild
                dissidents, as the growth of political opposition.
                Also, the internal political struggles didn't stop
                after the handover [of power to new leaders], but are
                developing&nbsp;… The third plenum is coming, and
                they need to avoid letting anything affect the internal
                struggles."</p>

              <p>The event carries symbolic weight because Deng
                Xiaoping used a third plenum in 1978 to establish his
                vision of economic reform and opening.</p>

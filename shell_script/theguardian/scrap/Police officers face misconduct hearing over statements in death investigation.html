                officers involved in detaining a man who later died are
                facing disciplinary charges of gross misconduct for
                allegedly omitting important details from their
                statements to an official investigation.</p>

              <p>Habib Ullah, 39, died after being stopped and searched
                in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in July 2008 by
                Thames Valley officers who suspected that he possessed
                drugs.</p>

              <p>One of the five officers will also face a gross
                misconduct charge for a "back slap" on Ullah during the
                incident.</p>

              <p>The announcement of the discipline charges came from
                the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC),
                which initially exonerated the officers without
                interviewing them. The case will bring into question
                the effectiveness of the police complaints system.</p>

              <p>Also on Friday, the Crown Prosecution Service
                announced that the officers would not face criminal
                charges. Ullah's family condemned the decision, which
                they said was part of a cover-up.</p>

              <p>Six years on from the death, Ullah's family say they
                are waiting for justice. The officers, who were correct
                in their suspicions that he possessed drugs, now face a
                hearing that could lead to them being sacked.</p>

              <p>The IPCC concluded its initial investigation by
                December 2009 and did not send a file about a possible
                criminal case to the CPS. Officers gave written
                statements to the IPCC and were treated as witnesses.</p>

              <p>The case was reopened after police admitted at an
                inquest in 2010 to removing material from written
                statements about the incident. Ullah's family claimed
                the information was potentially significant and the
                inquest was halted.</p>

              <p>It was claimed that the removal of the material
                followed legal advice from their solicitor, who was
                provided by the Police Federation.</p>

              <p>On Friday the IPCC said the five officers would face a
                gross misconduct hearing for "leaving out materially
                significant details from the statements they submitted
                to the IPCC investigation and for subsequently failing
                to correct this omission".</p>

              <p>Officers said they had seen Ullah swallowing drugs. He
                was stopped and searched and then restrained. Ullah, a
                father of three from Slough, in Berkshire, collapsed
                and later died in hospital.</p>

              <p>The questions about the police statements led to the
                inquest being halted and to the IPCC reopening a
                criminal inquiry. The officers and their solicitor were
                interviewed under caution. The officers were
                investigated for possible offences including
                manslaughter, and they and the solicitor were
                investigated over a claim of perverting the course of
                justice.</p>

              <p>The IPCC said it would send its evidence about the
                police lawyer's conduct to the Solicitors Regulation
                Authority.</p>

              <p>Ullah's sister Nasrit Mahmood said: "At the inquest
                they are caught out withholding evidence in front of
                everyone including the judge and jury. We have evidence
                of police cover-ups, so not only is it my opinion that
                they caused my brother's death but these police
                officers have not given a full and truthful account.</p>

              <p>"How on earth can CPS disregard the facts? This sadly
                shows that the CPS together with the IPCC are only
                there to protect and cover up police crimes. Their
                decision has only shown their true colours but made us
                much stronger."</p>

              <p>Explaining its reasons for not bringing charges over
                the alleged omissions from the police statements, the
                CPS said: "There is insufficient evidence to prove that
                the actions of the officers and solicitor, in altering
                the statements, tended to and were intended to pervert
                the course of justice. There is also insufficient
                evidence to prove that any officer wilfully made a
                material statement he knew to be false or did not
                believe to be true.</p>

              <p>"The evidence showed that there was no attempt to
                conceal that statements had been altered, and indicated
                that any alterations were intended to give a more
                accurate version of events, rather than to be
                misleading."</p>

              <p>A CPS spokesperson said: "Since there is insufficient
                evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of
                convicting any person of any criminal offence arising
                from the circumstances of Mr Ullah's death, we have
                advised the IPCC that no further criminal action should
                be taken."</p>

              <p>The IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said:
                "This has been a complex investigation which as we have
                said has taken an unbearably long time for Mr Ullah's
                family. I am very sorry for the prolonged distress this
                has caused, but it has been essential to ensure that
                our investigation was robust and thorough."</p>

              <p>The officers had remained on duty until Thursday. The
                decision not to bring criminal charges means the
                inquest into Ullah's death can resume at a future date.</p>

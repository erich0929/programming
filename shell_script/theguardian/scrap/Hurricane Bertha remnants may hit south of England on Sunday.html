              <p>There is a 60% to 70% chance that the remnants of
                hurricane Bertha, which has been downgraded to an
                Atlantic depression, will hit the south of England on
                Sunday, according to the Met Office.</p>

              <p>"The situation is still very uncertain," said Laura
                Young, a Met Office spokeswoman. "[The storm] is coming
                in our general direction, and one of the tracks we're
                looking at is that it comes across the South Downs,
                through the Wash and out through the east coast into
                the North Sea."</p>

              <p>Rain and strong gusts of wind could affect the whole
                of the east coast, reaching as far as the north-east,
                she said. "We're looking at up to 50mm of rain, but we
                don't know the intensity of the wind at the moment and
                that's what's causing us some problems," said Young.</p>

              <p>The average rainfall for the whole of August in
                England is 69mm.</p>

              <p>The Met Office said there was still a 30% to 40%
                chance of the storm missing the UK completely, passing
                through northern France instead. "That would leave the
                south with some very calm <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/weather" title="More from the Guardian on Weather">weather</a>
                on Sunday," said Young.</p>

              <p>The direction and intensity of the storm depend on
                whether it fragments and weakens as it comes across the
                Atlantic, so the next 24 hours are critical for
                predicting the implications for the UK.</p>

              <p>The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for
                Sunday, covering Wales and southern England.</p>

              <p>Bertha is the second hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic
                hurricane season. It passed through the Caribbean
                earlier this week, leaving thousands of homes without
                power. Parts of Puerto Rico saw 25mm of rainfall, with
                some mountainous regions receiving as much as 254mm.</p>

              <p>Bertha is currently off the coast of New York and is
                moving across the Atlantic towards northern Europe.</p>

              <p>On Thursday, <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2014/bertha" title="">Craig Woolhouse, flood risk manager at the
                Environment Agency</a>, said there was some chance of
                flooding in parts of the UK on Sunday and Monday. "A
                combination of high spring tides and strong westerly
                winds brings a possible risk of flooding to the
                south-west coast of England and along the Severn
                estuary, while heavy rain may also lead to localised
                surface water flooding in parts of southern and central
                England."</p>

              <p>He advised people to check the forecast frequently in
                the next few days.</p>

                  <p>American warplanes began bombing Islamic militant
                    targets outside the Kurdish city of Irbil on
                    Friday, in the first offensive action by the US in
                    Iraq since it withdrew ground troops in 2011.</p>

                  <p>Following authority granted by Barack Obama on
                    Thursday, the Pentagon said two FA-18 jets dropped
                    500-pound laser-guided bombs on fighters with the
                    Islamic State, also known as Isis or Isil.</p>

                  <p> The US claimed the militants were using artillery
                    to shell peshmerga forces defending Irbil and
                    threatening US personnel in the city.</p>

                  <p>“As the president made clear, the United States
                    military will continue to take direct action
                    against Isil when they threaten our personnel and
                    facilities,” said Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral
                    John Kirby.</p>

                  <p>Obama’s orders to his military commanders were
                    widely drafted and included permission to take
                    action against Isis forces threatening either the
                    thousands of Yazidi refugees trapped on Mount
                    Sinjar, or the cities of Irbil and Baghdad, where
                    US “military advisers” are based.</p>

                  <p>The US portrayed its initial action on Friday as a
                    necessary step to protect its joint operation
                    centre in Irbil, which is being used to co-ordinate
                    defences with Peshmerga fighters. “The fact of
                    the matter is we have people in Irbil and if Irbil
                    is allow to fall, they will be at risk,” said
                    national security adviser Ben Rhodes on Friday.</p>

                  <p>But US jets have been operating over Kurdish areas
                    for some time and the Pentagon believes the Islamic
                    militants advancing toward Irbil pose a significant
                    threat to the city.</p>

                  <p>Since Obama spoke from the White House on Thursday
                    night, there has been relatively little criticism
                    of his return to Iraqi military interventions in
                    Congress. However there is thought to be deep
                    unease within the White House about the risk of
                    being sucked back into a prolonged campaign against
                    Isis.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>White House officials, briefing reporters on
                    Thursday night, made clear that the latest
                    intervention was triggered by the rapid Isis
                    advance on Irbil, although Obama also stressed the
                    need for the US to take action to prevent possible
                    genocide of the Yazidi population.</p>

                  <p>Separate humanitarian air drops have already began
                    to bring relief to the thousands of trapped
                    Yazidis. Obama described the threats against the
                    stranded refugees as holding the potential for
                    “genocide”.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="US                   jets attack positions near Irbil"> <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img                   src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1407505875598/Iraq_airStrikes_irbil2_WEB.svg&quot;style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe>
                  </figure>
                  <p>The two FA-18 Hornets that carried out Friday’s
                    operation were launched from the USS George HW Bush
                    aircraft carrier in the Gulf. The operation began
                    at 1.45pm local time (6.45am ET, 11.45am BST).</p>

                  <p>Following Obama’s authorisation to his military
                    commanders, they are able to act independently of
                    the White House on tactical matters. “The
                    decision to strike was made by the US central
                    command commander under authorisation granted him
                    by the commander-in-chief,” said Kirby.</p>

                  <p>In Congress, Republicans and many Democrats
                    welcomed the US intervention but questioned White
                    House strategy for dealing the broader threat from
                    Isis.</p>

                  <p>“The president’s authorization of airstrikes
                    is appropriate, but like many Americans, I am
                    dismayed by the ongoing absence of a strategy for
                    countering the grave threat Isis poses to the
                    region,” said House speaker John Boehner<a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-statement-us-air-strikes-iraq#sthash.MNEYx8Xq.dpuf">
                    in a statement</a>.</p>

                  <p>“Vital national interests are at stake, yet the
                    White House has remained disengaged despite
                    warnings from Iraqi leaders, Congress, and even
                    members of its own administration. Such parochial
                    thinking only emboldens the enemy and squanders the
                    sacrifices Americans have made.”</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that
                    cargo planes dropped parachuted crates of food and
                    water over an area in the mountains outside Sinjar,
                    where thousands of members of the Yazidi minority
                    where sheltering, according to witnesses in the
                    militant-held town, who asked not to be identified
                    for security reasons.</p>

                  <p>The Iraqi ministry of immigration and the
                    displaced welcomed the aid drops. The ministry’s
                    spokesman, Satar Nawrouz, said the drops came
                    “just in time.”</p>

                  <p>Tens of thousands of Yazidis have been trapped in
                    the mountains since the Islamic State overran
                    Sinjar. The militants issued an ultimatum to the
                    Yazidis, telling them they must convert to Islam,
                    pay a religious tax, flee or face death.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Faced with the threats, about 50,000 Yazidis half
                    of them children, according to UN figures fled to
                    the nearby mountains, where they were running out
                    of food and water.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>On a visit to India, US defence secretary Chuck
                    Hagel told reporters that more than 60 of the 72
                    bundles of food and water airdropped onto the
                    mountain reached the people stranded there.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>A representative of Iraq’s most influential
                    Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani,
                    called for a more comprehensive international
                    intervention to support the Iraqi government.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“The condemnation and consolation statements in
                    support of the affected people, or sending some
                    humanitarian aid, is not enough. Rather, solid
                    plans, in cooperation with the Iraqi government,
                    should be put in place to confront and eliminate
                    the terrorists,” said al-Sistani’s spokesman
                    Abdul-Mahdi al-Karbalaie in his Friday sermon in
                    the holy city of Karbala.</p>

                  <p>Isis, which has carved out a self-styled caliphate
                    across wide swaths of Syria and Iraq, seized
                    Iraq’s largest hydroelectric dam on Thursday,
                    taking control of enormous power and water
                    resources and leverage over the Tigris River that
                    runs through the heart of Baghdad.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>On Thursday the group said it has seized 17 Iraqi
                    cities, towns and targets including the dam and a
                    military base over the past five days, including
                    Qaraqoush, the largest Christian village in Iraq.</p>

                  <p>In Irbil, about 3,000 Christians who fled their
                    homes in Qaraqoush huddled inside St. Joseph’s
                    cathedral. They said they were happy about the
                    possibility of American airstrikes. “We are
                    pleased with the airstrikes and we hope we can go
                    back to our properties,” said one of the
                    Qaraqoush refugees, 43-year-old Luay Janan.</p>

                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>More than 40 Australian women were diagnosed with
                    breast cancer on the day a political storm
                    developed over comments by a senior Abbott
                    government minister referencing a discredited link
                    to abortion.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The Breast Cancer Network Australia sought to
                    reassure women that there was no evidence of a link
                    between abortion and breast cancer, saying people
                    experienced shock when diagnosed and the last thing
                    they needed was “any further and unnecessary
                    anxiety”.</p>

                  <p>The government’s leader in the Senate and
                    employment minister, Eric Abetz, denied endorsing
                    the claim but faced calls to apologise <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/eric-abetz-under-fire-for-backing-false-claims-linking-abortion-to-breast-cancer">for
                    referring to it in a television interview</a>.</p>

                  <p>The acting leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said
                    Abetz should say sorry for insulting “not just
                    any woman who has suffered breast cancer or who has
                    had an abortion, but all women”.</p>

                  <p>Labor sought to build pressure on Abetz to cancel
                    plans to host lunch with a proponent of the view,
                    the American anti-abortion campaigner and doctor
                    Angela Lanfranchi, who also opposes use of the
                    contraceptive pill.</p>

                  <p>The Australian Medical Association (AMA) was
                    particularly scathing, saying <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/aug/08/eric-abetz-under-fire-for-abortion-breast-cancer-comments-video">the
                    comments</a> were “very unhelpful, both for
                    people who might be struggling with the concept of
                    termination of pregnancy … but also for people
                    that have suffered or have family members that have
                    suffered from breast cancer”.</p>

                  <p>Tony Abbott said he had spoken with Abetz, who was
                    “feeling a little sheepish about the way his
                    comments have skyrocketed” and would not repeat
                    the remarks.</p>

                  <p>“That so-called research has long been
                    discredited,” the prime minister said of the
                    abortion-breast cancer claim.</p>

                  <p>In the interview with <a href="http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project?psearch=Google">Ten’s
                    The Project</a> on Thursday night, Abetz said he
                    was supporting an upcoming event of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/victorias-attorney-general-to-address-anti-abortion-and-anti-gay-campaigners">World
                    Congress of Families</a> in Melbourne “based on
                    their basic views and beliefs that they support the
                    traditional view of marriage and that they are
                    pro-life”.</p>

                  <p>When asked by the panellist and Mamamia publisher
                    Mia Freedman whether he agreed with the
                    “factually incorrect statement” promoted by
                    Lanfranchi that abortion led to breast cancer,
                    Abetz said: “I think the studies, and I think
                    they date back from the 1950s, assert that there is
                    a link between abortion and breast cancer.”</p>

                  <p>Freedman replied that it was “conclusively and
                    scientifically incorrect” in the same way that
                    the linking of vaccination to autism was incorrect.</p>

                  <p>Abetz: “Well, I don’t know what your
                    scientific expertise is to be able to run that
                    commentary; I confess that I don’t have the
                    scientific expertise.”</p>

                  <p>Freedman: “It’s not me, it’s the AMA.”</p>

                  <p>Abetz: “Well there are other organisations that
                    have differing views as some of these speakers are
                    clinical professors.”</p>

                  <p>The alleged link has been rejected by leading
                    health organisations including <a href="http://canceraustralia.gov.au/affected-cancer/cancer-types/breast-cancer/your-risk-and-breast-cancer/risk-factors/unproven-risk-factors">Cancer
                    Australia</a>, the <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf">World
                    Health Organisation</a>, the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/abortion-miscarriage">US
                    National Cancer Institute</a>, and the London-based
                    <a href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-opinions/briefings-and-qas-/human-fertilisation-and-embryology-bill/brie-4">Royal
                    College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a>.</p>

                  <p>An American College of Obstetricians and
                    Gynecologists committee <a href="http://www.acog.org/~/media/Committee%20Opinions/Committee%20on%20Gynecologic%20Practice/co434.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130601T0701301666">concluded
                    in 2009</a>: “Early studies of the relationship
                    between prior induced abortion and breast cancer
                    risk were methodologically flawed. More rigorous
                    recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship
                    between induced abortion and a subsequent increase
                    in breast cancer risk.”</p>

                  <p>Abetz issued a statement saying it was incorrect
                    for the media to claim he had drawn a link, or
                    believed there was a link, between abortion and
                    breast cancer.</p>

                  <p>“In my interview last night on The Project I
                    studiously avoided doing so, and was cut off before
                    being able to acknowledge that Dr Angela
                    Lanfranchi’s views on this topic were not the
                    accepted medical view,” he said.</p>

                  <p>Abetz said his support for the World Congress of
                    Families did not mean he endorsed the view of every
                    single speaker, although he defended Lanfranchi’s
                    credentials as “a breast cancer surgeon and a
                    clinical assistant professor of surgery”.</p>

                  <p>“I accept the AMA has a right to disagree with
                    Dr Lanfranchi’s views,” Abetz said.</p>

                  <p>On 28 August Abetz is scheduled to host a luncheon
                    at Parliament House for Lanfranchi and two other
                    people listed to speak at the World Congress of
                    Families in Melbourne: Louise Kirk and Dr Larry
                    Jacobs.</p>

                  <p>Kirk is a <a href="http://www.alivetotheworld.co.uk/background">UK-based
                    campaigner</a> who aims to “<a href="http://catholicismpure.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/louise-kirk-takes-on-the-sex-ed-establishment/">turn
                    around the ghastliness</a> of sex education” and
                    is making a presentation in Melbourne titled
                    “sexuality – a gift for life”. <a href="http://profam.org/people/xthc_jacobs.htm">Jacobs</a>
                    is due to present at the same conference “on the
                    pro-life and <a href="http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue2930.html">pro-family</a>
                    policies in the US and Russia”, according to the
                    conference program.</p>

                  <p>While in Canberra, Lanfranchi is due to speak at
                    an event organised by the Australian Capital
                    Territory Right to Life Association.</p>

                  <p>Labor’s health spokeswoman, Catherine King, said
                    Abetz’s interview comments were “appalling”
                    and the statement issued on Friday morning fell
                    short of the “complete retraction” required.</p>

                  <p>“I think the fact that he is hosting the person
                    who is purporting this link at a luncheon at
                    Parliament House says entirely that unfortunately
                    he does endorse these comments and I think it goes
                    to the heart of the prejudice frankly of this
                    government,” King said.</p>

                  <p>“For women waking up this morning who have been
                    diagnosed with breast cancer or who are trying to
                    work through those terrible issues around making
                    decisions with their doctor about whether to
                    terminate a pregnancy, to wake up to this news this
                    morning, frankly, is absolutely appalling and those
                    comments should be condemned.”</p>

                  <p>The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the
                    comments were “truly repulsive”, hurtful,
                    ignorant and had no place in modern Australian
                    society.</p>

                  <p>The health minister, Peter Dutton, said he
                    believed “the medical evidence needs to be the
                    driver in this area and it is clear that there is
                    no link between abortion and breast cancer”.</p>

                  <p>The chief executive of the Breast Cancer Network
                    Australia, Maxine Morand, said she worried the
                    matter was “creating completely unnecessary
                    anxiety about the cause of breast cancer”.</p>

                  <p>“It’s hard enough already when you get
                    diagnosed with breast cancer: it’s a shock and
                    it’s really emotional and it’s probably not
                    uncommon for people to try to understand the cause
                    and question why. The last thing you’d want is
                    someone to create any further and unnecessary
                    anxiety about the non-existent relationship,” she
                    told Guardian Australia.</p>

                  <p>“This is a really common disease. Forty-two
                    women just today have been told they have breast
                    cancer and they’re having to deal with that
                    diagnosis and the last thing they need is something
                    else to cloud their experience.</p>

                  <p>“No one wants any of those women diagnosed at
                    any point including today to be under any
                    misconception that there’s any relationship
                    between abortion and breast cancer.”</p>

                  <p>Morand said she was “pleased [that] Eric Abetz
                    is now saying that he doesn’t think that there is
                    a link” but by hosting the luncheon for
                    Lanfranchi was “sending two very different
                    messages”.</p>

                  <p>“On one hand he’s saying he doesn’t believe
                    there’s a link and yet he still looks to host the
                    person making that claim at lunch,” she said.
                    “He’s sending confusing messages about what he
                    believes.”</p>

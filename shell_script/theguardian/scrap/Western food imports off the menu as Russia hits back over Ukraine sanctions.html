              <p>Russians will no longer be able to buy fruit,
                vegetables, meat, fish or dairy products from the EU
                and the US, as the full scope of Moscow's food import
                ban became apparent on Thursday.</p>

              <p>President Vladimir Putin told officials on Wednesday
                to come up with a list of western agricultural products
                and raw materials to be banned, in reaction to western
                sanctions over <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia" title="More from the Guardian on Russia">Russia</a>'s
                policies in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine" title="More from the Guardian on Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>

              <p>Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said the ban
                was effective immediately and would last for a year. It
                covers most foodstuffs from the US, the 28 EU
                countries, Canada, Australia and Norway.</p>

              <p>"Until the last moment, we hoped that our foreign
                colleagues would realise that sanctions lead to a blind
                alley, and that no one benefits from them. But they
                didn't realise this, and now we have been forced to
                respond," Medvedev said.</p>

              <p>The EU and US have sanctioned a number of Russians,
                including billionaires believed to be close to Putin
                and those actively involved in the annexing Crimea and
                the unrest in eastern Ukraine. After the downing of
                Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which pro-Russia rebels
                are believed to have shot down , a number of key
                Russian banks were also sanctioned, cutting them off
                from European capital markets.</p>

              <p>The key question is whether the import ban would hurt
                European producers more than Russian consumers. The
                Kremlin's English-language channel, Russia Today, said
                the food ban could spark a "crisis in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" title="More from the Guardian on Europe">Europe</a>"
                and would cost billions of pounds in lost revenues.</p>

              <p>There was less musing on the cost to ordinary
                Russians, who have become used to readily available
                imported foods.</p>

              <p>"I am sure that our market will be filled with fresh
                quality Russian products, which anyway many Russians
                prefer to the imported ones," said Medvedev.</p>

              <p>The agriculture minister, Nikolai Fyodorov, said more
                Brazilian meat and New Zealand cheese would be imported
                to offset the newly prohibited items. He also said
                Moscow was in talks with Belarus and Kazakhstan to
                prevent the banned western foodstuffs being exported to
                Russia from the two countries.</p>

              <p>Medvedev said Russia was prepared to introduce further
                measures in aviation, shipbuilding and automobile
                sectors, but said it would do so carefully. Moscow has
                already floated the idea of banning European airlines
                from flying over Russian airspace, which could add
                several hours to some flights between Europe and Asia.</p>

              <p>Russia is Europe's second-largest market for food and
                drink. Exports of food and raw materials to Russia were
                worth €12.2bn (£9.7bn) in 2013, following several
                years of double-digit growth.</p>

              <p>The UK is less likely to lose out. In 2013, its
                biggest food and drink export was £17m of frozen fish,
                followed by £5.7m of cheese and £5.3m of coffee.</p>

              <p>The president of the European Central bank, Mario
                Draghi, said on Thursday that the Ukraine crisis was
                contributing to heightened geopolitical risks that are
                threatening the eurozone's faltering recovery. "Some of
                them, like the situation in Ukraine and Russia will
                have a greater impact on the euro area than they …
                have on other parts of the world," he said.</p>

              <p>The world's second-largest bottler of Coca-Cola drinks
                has become the latest company to be hit by the
                escalating standoff between Russia and the west, along
                with the sportswear maker Adidas.</p>

              <p>Coca-Cola HBC, which bottles and distributes the US
                company's drinks in 28 countries, said volumes would
                fall for the rest of the year, citing a sudden
                deterioration in Russia, its biggest market.</p>

              <p>Financial markets were quick to react to Putin's
                tit-for-tat move. Moscow's main two share indices
                extended Wednesday's sharp declines, with retail and
                banking shares among the biggest fallers. The RTS index
                lost 1.9%, and the rouble-denominated Micex fell 1.5%.
                European indices were also weaker.</p>

              <p>Food has already been caught up in political tensions
                between Russia and the west. Moscow's food safety
                authorities have recently banned the import of Polish
                fruit and vegetables, and a regional branch of the
                consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor is
                investigating McDonald's cheeseburgers and milkshakes.</p>

              <p>European pork was banned at the start of the year as
                the Ukraine crisis escalated, cutting off 25% of all EU
                pig meat exports in a move that the European commission
                said exposed farmers to significant losses.</p>

              <p>The EU and US stepped up punitive action against
                Russia last week in response to Moscow's support for
                eastern separatists in Ukraine, which has been
                unwavering despite the downing of MH17.</p>

              <p>A Dutch rescue team had to abandon its work at the
                crash site on Thursday, judging that the frontline of
                fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed
                rebels was too close.</p>

              <p>Ukrainian forces have made gains in the east in recent
                weeks, but at the expense of civilian casualties. The
                rebels are now mainly holed up in the regional centres
                of Donetsk and Luhansk, leaving Kiev with a dilemma of
                how to win back the strongholds without enormous
                civilian loss of life.</p>

              <p>Russia is carrying out military exercises near the
                border with Ukraine this week, and there are fears that
                the option of a ground invasion is still on the table.
                Nato said earlier this week that Moscow had amassed
                around 20,000 troops near the border and could be
                planning an invasion under the guise of a humanitarian
                intervention.</p>

              <p>In Kiev, there were clashes on Thursday morning as
                authorities attempted to clear Independence Square,
                known as the Maidan, of tents and protesters. The
                square was the centre of the protests against President
                Viktor Yanukovych's rule, and a small hardcore of
                protesters have refused to move on and have remained
                living in the square since Yanukovych was deposed in
                February.</p>

              <p>The square was cleared by armed members of volunteer
                battalions which had returned from fighting the
                pro-Russia separatists in the east, themselves made up
                of former Maidan activists. The violent clashes suggest
                tough times ahead for Ukraine, where President Petro
                Poroshenko will have to deal with the presence of many
                armed volunteer groups when the crisis in the east is
                over.</p>

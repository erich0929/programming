              <p>Turks will on Sunday cast their ballots in the
                country's first direct presidential elections, and few
                doubt that the prime minister, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan" title="More from the Guardian on Recep Tayyip                 Erdogan">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>, will easily beat his
                main rival.</p>

              <p>The Turkish head of state used to be chosen by
                parliament, but a 2010 referendum allowed Turks to
                choose their president in direct elections. For the
                first time, more than three million Turks living abroad
                can also vote.</p>

              <p>Erdogan is up against the 70-year-old scholar
                Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu and the Kurdish politician
                Selahattin Demirtas, 41, who is the co-chair of the
                Democratic People's party (HDP). Ihsanoglu has the
                support of several opposition parties, including that
                of the Republican People's party (CHP). However, few
                observers have any doubt who will win.</p>

              <p>"Recep Tayyip Erdogan will become the next president",
                Nurullah Baldir, a master halva-maker in Soma, west <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey" title="More from the Guardian on Turkey">Turkey</a>,
                stated confidently. "He is the best man for the job.''</p>

              <p>Recent polls suggest Baldir's enthusiasm is shared by
                at least half the country. But his whole-hearted
                support might not have been counted on three months ago
                when Soma became the scene of Turkey's worst ever
                industrial accident.</p>

              <p>After a blast tore through a local coal mine, killing
                301 workers, a flood of accusations blamed crony
                capitalism and the cosy relationship between the mine
                operator Soma Holding and Erdogan's ruling Justice and
                Development party (AKP).</p>

              <p>When the prime minister visited the mine, he showed
                little empathy for the town. He said such accidents
                were "the fate of miners", and reportedly slapped a
                girl when angry locals protested along his motorcade,
                calling him a thief and a murderer. One of his closest
                aides was seen kicking a grieving miner in the street.</p>

              <p>But Erdogan's face is plastered all over town. Huge
                posters and banners promote him as a strong future
                president and as the representative of what he calls
                "the national will".</p>

              <p>"Turkey has come a long way under our prime minister",
                Baldir said. "Our economy is doing well now, the people
                are better off. Just look at the roads! He transformed
                the country and made it much stronger. Of course I will
                vote for him this Sunday! He is a blessing for Turkey."</p>

              <p>"Soma will vote for Erdogan again, you will see",
                agreed a Soma miner, who wished to remain anonymous.
                "The government paid the families of those who were
                killed, and promised them a free flat. They know how to
                get people to forget about what really happened here.</p>

              <p>"At least they had the decency not to offer us money
                again to attend election rallies. And Erdogan's
                election vans only started driving around town the day
                after they started paying miners theirs salary again
                not long ago. But now they are confident again and he
                will win, no matter what."</p>

              <p>The post of president has been largely symbolic in
                Turkey, but Erdogan has expressed his wish to increase
                presidential powers, leading to fears in the opposition
                that his victory might lead to a Putin-style power
                grab, keeping the 60-year-old at the helm of Turkish
                politics for years to come.</p>

              <p>Critics have pointed out that his position as prime
                minister and his firm grip on the media have given him
                an unfair advantage during the election campaign.</p>

              <p>AKP municipalities and companies close to the
                government provide public space, making Erdogan the
                most visible candidate. According to local media
                reports, state broadcaster TRT devoted 533 minutes to
                the prime minister between 4 and 6 July, while
                Ihsanoglu was covered for little more than three
                minutes and Demirtas for a mere 45 seconds. The
                Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe
                (OSCE) said large-scale government events, such as the
                inauguration of a new high-speed train, were often
                combined with Erdogan's campaign activities.</p>

              <p>In a speech at a rally in Istanbul that was only
                partly broadcast on TV, Demirtas condemned the lopsided
                election campaign, saying: "Elections have been turned
                into an extremely ugly race in which the AKP's
                candidate is competing unfairly with the backing of all
                benefits of the state, financial power, media power."</p>

              <p>To claim victory and become president after the first
                round on Sunday, Erdogan must secure an absolute
                majority of the popular vote. If he fails, he will have
                to go to a runoff against the candidate with the second
                highest percentage – widely expected to be Ihsanoglu
                – on 24 August.</p>

              <p>Analysts point out that a failure to claim first round
                victory would be a catastrophe for Erdogan and the AKP.</p>

              <p>"Going into a second round would be a major defeat for
                the AKP and would represent a detrimental blow to the
                legitimacy of Recep Tayyip Erdogan as president," said
                Gencer Özcan, professor for international relations at
                Bilgi University in Istanbul. "It would put in question
                his project to change the constitution and transform
                Turkey's government into a presidential system."</p>

              <p>In recent speeches, Erdogan has clearly expressed his
                wish to fulfil more than just a symbolic role and to be
                "an active president", vowing to use the full extent of
                his constitutional powers and to participate in
                day-to-day politics. He has also underlined a partisan
                approach: "A president cannot be impartial. No
                president in this country has been neutral. And I won't
                be an impartial president, either."</p>

              <p>Ihsanoglu has warned that the president should only
                hold the position of referee, arguing that the hasty
                creation of an incomplete presidential system would
                create a Frankenstein's monster.</p>

              <p>Özcan predicted the period after the elections would
                be crucial to the future of the AKP, and Turkish
                politics: "On paper it seems like Erdogan took all
                necessary precautions to remain at the head of his
                party. But his election as president spells a
                considerable political problem to the AKP. Who will
                rule the party after Erdogan? Who will take over what
                post? This might be the start of a major power struggle
                inside the ruling party."</p>

                  <p>The trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of
                    Reeva Steenkamp has concluded and Judge Thokozile
                    Masipa – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e29a86e4b0c8aa99e2b0ba">there
                    is no jury</a> – will return to hand down her
                    verdict <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-liv">on
                    11 September</a>.</p>

                  <p>Here is a summary of the closing arguments by the
                    state, which argues that Pistorius should be found
                    guilty of premeditated murder, and the defence,
                    which says he should be acquitted.</p>

                  <p>The athlete denies murder, saying he mistakenly
                    shot his girlfriend in the early hours of 14
                    February 2013 believing there was an intruder in
                    the house.</p>

                  <h2>The state’s case</h2>

                  <p>The prosecution says Pistorius is guilty of
                    murder. Lead counsel for the state Gerrie Nel told
                    the court that the accused’s actions in fetching
                    the gun and walking down the corridor towards the
                    bathroom indicates premeditation: “He had lots of
                    time for reflection. He made up his mind in the
                    bedroom when he armed himself. That is
                    pre-planning.”<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Nel said Pistorius was an “appalling witness”
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-witness-closing-arguments-reeva-steenkamp">whose
                    testimony was “devoid of truth </a>… The
                    accused is more interested in fending for his life
                    than in entrusting the court with a truthful
                    account.”</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e33ea1e4b036294986ed59">The
                    prosecutor highlighted what he called significant
                    incongruities in the defence case</a>, arguing that
                    conflicting evidence about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e33f81e4b0489f499be6d2">position
                    of fans</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e34200e4b0c8aa99e2b12f">a
                    duvet</a> in the accused’s bedroom proved
                    Pistorius was tailoring his evidence to mask the
                    fact that he knew it was Steenkamp in the toilet
                    cubicle when he fired four shots through the door.
                    There is no proof the police tampered with the
                    crime scene, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e33d63e4b0c8aa99e2b12b">Nel
                    said</a>. The position of items in the bedroom
                    means Pistorius’ version cannot be true.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Whether he believed the person behind the door was
                    an intruder or knew it was Steenkamp, it was murder
                    by dolus directus (premeditated murder) or dolus
                    eventualis (he must have known he was likely to
                    kill the person by firing). Nel told the judge:
                    “The accused intended to kill a human being. He
                    knew there was a human being in that toilet.
                    That’s his evidence … He is guilty of murder.
                    There must be consequences for it.”</p>

                  <p>But Nel insisted Pistorius knew it was Steenkamp.
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e350eae4b0c8aa99e2b147">She
                    was facing the door</a> when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e338fce4b0489f499be6cb">he
                    fired directly at her</a>. He said<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36e1de4b047cac37a56f1">
                    WhatsApp messages between the pair </a>show they
                    were having problems, with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/oscar-pistorius-scared-girlfriend-murder-trial-hears">Steenkamp
                    saying she was “scared”</a> of her boyfriend.
                    Nel told the court: “This was not a normal
                    relationship. This relationship ended in death.”</p>

                  <p>The prosecution contends that the pair were
                    arguing. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e369c8e4b047cac37a56ec">A
                    witness says she heard a row</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36717e4b047cac37a56e9">another
                    saw the bathroom light on</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36cbfe4b03949a79a6601">Steenkamp’s
                    stomach contents</a> indicate she was awake and
                    eating several hours after Pistorius said they had
                    gone to sleep. “Nobody went to bed in that
                    house,” Nel said. “Nobody was sleeping.”</p>

                  <p>State witnesses who said they heard a woman showed
                    “extraordinary corroboration” in their
                    independent statements to police. Witnesses also
                    heard <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36805e4b0d23f0985fcdb">“intermingling”
                    screams</a> of a man and a woman, disputing claims
                    by the defence that the only screams on the night
                    were that of Pistorius.</p>

                  <p>The other charges (see below) faced, and denied,
                    by Pistorius show a pattern of behaviour in which
                    the athlete acts recklessly and does not take
                    responsibility for his actions, the state
                    argues.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The written heads of argument can be read in full

                  <h2>The case for the defence</h2>

                  <p>The defence says the trial should have begun with
                    a charge of culpable homicide <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e4c330e4b0d23f0985fdfb">rather
                    than murder</a>, but insists Pistorius should be
                    acquitted. If the firing of the gun was purely
                    reflexive, he lacked criminal capacity; if there
                    was a thought process, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e48607e4b03f89077d8973">it
                    was “putative private defence”
                    (self-defence)</a> because he believed he was in
                    danger – that an intruder was coming out of the
                    toilet. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e4ba4be4b03f89077d89ba">He
                    had no motive to kill Steenkamp</a>. He has always

                    he thought it was an intruder</a>.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e484ace4b047cac37a57b9">Lead
                    defence counsel Barry Roux compared Pistorius’
                    years of disability to an abused women who kills
                    her husband</a> after many assaults. The shooting
                    was a reflexive action after a “slow burn” of
                    vulnerabilities led to a point at which he had
                    “had enough”. He was anxious and acting on
                    “primal instinct”.</p>

                  <p>The defence says the state’s version of events
                    – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e48e58e4b0d23f0985fdbe">in
                    which the fatal shots were fired at 3.17am</a> –
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e4a340e4b03f89077d8992">cannot
                    be true</a>. The defence says noises heard at
                    3.17am were the thuds of the cricket bat as
                    Pistorius broke down the toilet door. The shots, it
                    contends, were earlier, which means <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e48d9ae4b03949a79a66f7">the
                    screams heard before 3.17am were made by the
                    accused</a>, and not by Steenkamp, who was already
                    fatally wounded. Roux asked the judge: “If the
                    shots were, as submitted by the state, at 3.17am
                    – would it make sense that before firing the
                    shots the accused would shout: help, help, help?”
                    It was “fatal for the state” that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e48e58e4b0d23f0985fdbe">a

                    2.20am and heard no arguing</a>.</p>

                  <p>State witnesses gave false evidence to the court,
                    Roux alleged. A neighbour, Dr Johan Stipp, had
                    tailored his evidence to try to assist the
                    state’s case, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/08/oscar-pistorius-trial-defence-closing-argument-live#block-53e4991be4b03f89077d898a">it

                    says Pistorius should be found guilty of a separate
                    charge of negligently discharging a firearm in a
                    restaurant</a>. Roux said the athlete did not
                    deliberately pull the trigger. He made a mistake.
                    Pistorius had pleaded not guilty to this charge.

                  <h2><strong>The charges Pistorius faces</strong></h2>

                  <p>If Masipa finds Pistorius guilty of
                    <strong>premeditated murder</strong> – that is,
                    he knowingly intended to kill Steenkamp, or
                    deliberately decided to kill an intruder – he
                    would face a mandatory life sentence. It would be
                    25 years before he would even be considered for
                    parole.</p>

                  <p>The judge will also consider whether he is guilty
                    of <strong>murder without premeditation</strong>:
                    an intent to kill, but with no planning, in the
                    heat of the moment. Sentencing for a guilty verdict
                    is at the judge’s discretion.</p>

                  <p>There is also the possibility of a
                    <strong>manslaughter, or culpable
                    homicide</strong>, conviction, if the judge
                    believes Pistorius’ claim that he did not mean to
                    kill Steenkamp, but decides he acted recklessly or
                    negligently in firing into the locked door.</p>

                  <p>Pistorius could be <strong>acquitted</strong> if
                    the judge accepts his account that he genuinely
                    feared for his life and thought he was
                    <strong>acting in self-defence.</strong></p>

                  <p>Alongside the charge of murder, Pistorius is
                    accused of two counts of discharging firearms in
                    public, and another of illegal possession of
                    ammunition.</p>

                  <p><strong><strong>Discharging firearms in public,
                    first count:</strong></strong> The prosecution says
                    he discharged a firearm at a restaurant in January
                    2013. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/oscar-pistorius-gun-shot-restaurant-reeva-steenkamp-trial">Pistorius
                    said his friend Darren Fresco had passed him the
                    loaded gun</a> and denies he deliberately pulled
                    the trigger. But the defence has now conceded that
                    he should be found guilty of negligence on this
                    charge.</p>

                  <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Discharging
                    firearms in public, second
                    count:</strong></strong></strong></strong>
                    Pistorius is accused of firing a gun through a car
                    sunroof while he was with Fresco and Pistorius’
                    then girlfriend Samantha Taylor in November 2012.
                    The athlete says he became angry after a police
                    officer inspected his gun when the car was stopped
                    for speeding, but denies firing it.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p><strong><strong>Illegal possession of ammunition:
                    </strong></strong>Pistorius is charged with being
                    in possession of .38 ammunition without a permit.
                    Pistorius told the court the bullets belonged to
                    his father and he had them for safe-keeping.</p>

                  <p>If found guilty, Pistorius could face five years
                    in prison on each of the first two firearms counts,
                    and 15 years for the illegal possession of
                    ammunition.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings" title="More from the Guardian on HSBC">HSBC</a> has
                been accused of unfairly targeting Syrians living in
                the UK after it was revealed the bank has written to a
                number of customers telling them it will close their
                accounts.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Manchester-based human rights group Rapar and the
                Syrian Rethink Rebuild Society, a not for profit
                organisation operating from the same city, said they
                have been working together to document cases in which
                Syrian nationals have been unfairly targeted by HSBC
                due to their nationality.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.rapar.org.uk/syria.html" title="">On its website Rapar said</a>: "The Syrian
                community of Manchester has been subject to various
                accounts of profiling based on nationality, including
                police visits, airport stops, and the revoking of
                British nationality from dual nationals who travel to
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria" title="More from the Guardian on Syria">Syria</a>. As a
                more recent development, financial institutions, most
                notably HSBC bank, have also been targeting their
                Syrian customers."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>It said the two groups, itself and Rehink Rebuild
                Society, have "uncovered a pattern of abuse on behalf
                of HSBC in which the bank has turned down customers,
                inhibited or closed accounts, or refused mortgages for
                customers because their identity is Syrian."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>One HSBC customer, Majid Maghout, a 26-year-old Syrian
                on a student visa, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/exclusive-shameless-hsbc-shuts-syrian-refugees-bank-accounts-in-britain-9655838.html#" title="">is quoted in the Independent</a> as saying he
                was not contacted by HSBC but that when he tried to
                withdraw money his debit card was swallowed by the ATM.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"I contacted HSBC and they simply told me my account
                would be closed and I should have received a letter
                from them," he told the Independent. "HSBC told me it
                had nothing to do with me as customer – the issue was
                that I was a Syrian citizen.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"I'm a student. I have no money and I'm here thanks to
                a scholarship. I live on £400 a month and I've never
                transferred money to Syria. This is a case of
                discrimination. They could have checked my balance and
                my records, but they simply decided to close my
                account."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Rapar has published extracts of some of the letters it
                claims HSBC has sent out to its Syrian customers on its
                website. One of them reads: "Our records show that you
                are a resident in a country that is subject to
                financial sanction restrictions. Due to the increased
                requirements for compliance with international
                obligations concerning payments to and from sanctioned
                countries, we have taken the decision to close the
                above account(s).</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"Please be assured that this decision is based on our
                own assessment of the risk and is not a reflection of
                you as a customer or the manner in which you have
                conducted you business with HSBC."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>It is not the first time HSBC has been accused of
                prejudice against its customers. Last week it caused
                outrage among some in the Muslim community when three
                Muslim organisations, including the Finsbury Park
                mosque, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/30/hsbc-shuts-accounts-muslim-organisations-finsbury-park-mosque" title="">were told by the bank that their accounts were
                being shut down</a>.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>The bank is likely to be taking a particularly
                cautious approach after <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering" title="">it was fined a record £1.2bn in 2012</a> to
                settle allegations it allowed Mexican drug traffickers
                to move money around the financial system.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>However, a spokesman for the bank said any decisions
                to close individual's accounts were "not based on race
                and religion" and that the closure of bank accounts
                held by Syrian nationals was in no way a "blanket
                approach".</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>"There are compliance issues to deal with regard to
                countries where there are financial sanctions and we
                want to have very high standards in this area," the
                spokesman said. "If you have links to those countries
                with sanctions then those links may be looked into.
                There are times when a review of an account is needed
                and that is done on an individual basis."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>He said that he could not disclose the detail of what
                the bank would look at when reviewing an account and
                that the reasons for closure would often not be shared
                with the account holder. However, he did say that any
                movement of money between Syria and the UK via the
                account would potentially be one reason.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>The Guardian has contacted a number of other UK banks
                including Santander, Lloyds and Barclays, to find out
                their approach to Syrian account holders but so far had
                no response.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said:
                "Banks are understandably cautious about transferring
                funds to Syria and it is no surprise that they maintain
                strict internal compliance policies and have invested
                in sophisticated 'screening' software to help them spot
                potential sanctions as well as terrorist financing
                issues."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>He added: "Many banks are operating an 'exceptions
                only policy' for transactions involving Syria – ie
                transactions will automatically be held for further
                scrutiny. As the situation deteriorates, transparency
                over arrangements with partners within Syria is
                reducing and satisfying due diligence will be
                increasingly challenging."</p>

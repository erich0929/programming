                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>Royal Bank of Scotland is dismantling its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/22/mps-accuse-rbs-chiefs-treasury-committee-small-business" title="">controversial restructuring division</a>,
                    with its head Derek Sach and another executive
                    leaving the bank in spring 2015.</p>

                  <p>Sach and Aubrey Adams, who runs the property unit
                    within the global restructuring group (GRG), are
                    leaving at the end of next March. Laura Barlow, who
                    currently heads up the restructuring team for the
                    UK and US within GRG, has been appointed as head of
                    RBS’s restructuring division with immediate
                    effect.</p>

                  <p>GRG, which deals with companies facing collapse,
                    has faced a barrage of criticism, notably from
                    Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to the business
                    secretary, Vince Cable. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/rbs-accused-business-profits-regulators" title="">He concluded in a report last November
                    that the unit forced viable small businesses</a> to
                    the brink so that the bank could buy up their
                    properties and make a profit. RBS then commissioned
                    law firm Clifford Chance to investigate the claims.
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/rbs-no-evidence-fraudulent-activity-report" title="">Its report said RBS did not deliberately
                    defraud customers</a>. The Financial Conduct
                    Authority is also investigating.</p>

                  <p>The move to close GRG as a standalone unit comes
                    in the wake of the UK’s economic recovery, which
                    has led to a sharp drop in the number of
                    restructuring cases. A few weeks ago, the RBS chief
                    executive, Ross McEwan, said the number of cases
                    being referred to GRG had dropped by 40%. RBS has
                    set up an internal bad bank, which has taken on a
                    lot of GRG cases.</p>

                  <p>The division dealt with a number of big turnaround
                    cases, including luggage maker Samsonite, Liverpool
                    FC and Thomas Cook.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/rbs-executives-deny-wrecking-small-businesses-profit" title="">Sach and Chris Sullivan, the bank’s
                    deputy chief executive, denied GRG was run as a
                    profit centre</a> when interrogated by MPs on the
                    Treasury select committee in June. In a letter to
                    committee chair Andrew Tyrie, Sullivan subsequently
                    admitted that the operation was run this way in
                    terms of its accounting basis.</p>

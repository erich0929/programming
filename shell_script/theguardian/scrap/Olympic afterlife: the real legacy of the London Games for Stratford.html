                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>We moved to Stratford in the autumn of 2011 – an
                    exigency forced on us by London’s housing bubble.
                    It was a reluctant emigration: the river Lea marked
                    the eastern boundary of my experience of the
                    capital, barring a few brief but harrowing visits
                    after falling asleep on night buses as a student 10
                    years earlier. There was only one good pub, and the
                    2012 Olympics, about which I felt no joy, loomed
                    large over the area. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>My block of flats was in a converted 1970s office
                    building on the traffic island at the heart of
                    Stratford, next to the old shopping centre. The
                    latter offered the same pound shops and sportswear
                    emporiums you can find on every British high
                    street, but it also housed a thriving market, with
                    a fish stall next to a Polish deli and an artisanal
                    cheesemaker. It was 21st-century East End commerce
                    in microcosm, peacefully cohabiting for once,
                    rather than engaged in a fight to the death.</p>

                  <p>Because it is a thoroughfare, the centre was (and
                    still is) left open all night, which is when things
                    got really interesting. After the sausages and
                    whelks had been cleared away, rollerbladers with
                    boomboxes would pirouette across the terrazzo,
                    dive-bombing drunks as they meandered home from the
                    station. To my surprise, I found the place
                    appealing to my romantic streak – I was on JG
                    Ballard’s concrete island, a not unhappy
                    castaway. <br/>

                  Smith</figcaption> </figure>
                  <p>Like the rest of Stratford, though, the old
                    shopping centre was at the mercy of the gods of
                    Olympus – and it clearly didn’t fit with the
                    image Newham council wanted to project to the
                    world. As the Games approached, the council tried
                    to hide the building behind a particularly
                    egregious piece of public art: a shoal of
                    iridescent lozenges on sticks. These concealed
                    nothing, merely added a citrusy top-note to the
                    dog’s dinner of the ring road.</p>

                  <p>A more substantial threat came from Westfield, the
                    gigantic mall and “gateway to the Games”, which
                    had opened shortly before I moved to the area. I
                    was sceptical about its boring shops and the threat
                    they posed to local businesses. Above all, I was
                    repulsed by the cacophonous architecture of the
                    place, and the fake public space inside. But
                    eventually I learned to love Westfield, too, for
                    the enormous relief of no longer having to go to
                    Oxford street for shopping – and for the
                    people-watching opportunities it afforded.
                    Thankfully, it also turned out to do the old
                    shopping centre little harm – footfall has if
                    anything increased there, thanks to Stratford’s
                    transformation into a shopping
                    “destination”.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>If, however, I was charmed by Stratford and
                    seduced by Westfield, there was one big unavoidable
                    blot on my new home’s escutcheon: the Olympics.
                    It wasn’t that I was outraged by the abuse of the
                    existing landscape. The psycho-geographer’s
                    romance of the Lea valley was never high on my
                    agenda – I like post-industrial wastelands as
                    much as the next man, but to leave a huge tranche
                    of inner-city land unoccupied in the middle of a
                    housing shortage is stupid. My problem was more
                    with what would be built on it, and for whom.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-ca2dfede-bd60-44b0-a6f2-1f89d313c3d5">

                  centre was initially criticised by many residents,
                  but some now see it as a positive factor for the
                  area. Photograph: Sean Smith</figcaption> </figure>
                  <p>The press image showing Danny Boyle towering over
                    a model set for his opening ceremony didn’t
                    assuage my suspicions that the pageant would be a
                    celebration of all that is cloying, limp, and
                    cap-doffing about our sceptered isles. The
                    architecture of the proposed venues seemed either
                    anodyne or meretricious, and the idea of
                    “legacy”, after the disasters of Athens and
                    Beijing, an outright lie. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Another irritant was that the Olympics had,
                    contrary to the nebulous promise of “inspiring a
                    generation”, actually made swimming and cycling
                    much harder to do in Stratford. The local pool had
                    been closed because asbestos was discovered during
                    refurbishment earlier that year, and the council
                    had clearly not bothered to sort it out because
                    Zaha Hadid was coming with her voluptuous aquatic
                    centre. And the relatively car-free cycle route
                    into town, which began on the linear park called
                    the Greenway that straddles Bazalgette’s
                    monstrous east-west sewage pipe, was quickly closed
                    for “security reasons” (it went through the
                    Olympic park). Instead, you had to cycle down the
                    thunderous high street and over Bow roundabout, the
                    nemesis of many a cyclist, before being spat out
                    onto the thin blue line of one of London’s most
                    dangerous cycle superhighways. This brush with
                    death was a nerve-jangling way to start the day,
                    more effective than any caffeine jolt.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>As the games approached, the religious maniacs who
                    clamoured outside the station grew ever more
                    hysterical. Others were getting a bit carried away,
                    too: a friend had volunteered to take part in the
                    opening ceremony, and her enthusiasm – which
                    regularly took her to a gigantic tent in an
                    industrial estate in Dagenham for rehearsals –
                    puzzled me. I couldn’t imagine the ceremony being
                    anything other than rubbish, but her assurances
                    that I was wrong gradually chipped away at my
                    scepticism, and when the day finally came, I was
                    feeling more open-minded. Crucially, I was also
                    drunk.</p>

                  back into anonymity. Photograph: David

                  <p>Watching the spectacle on a big screen in nearby
                    Haggerston park surrounded by hundreds of other
                    inebriates, I was won over. I even attended a few
                    events, including the Paralympic session when
                    George Osborne turned up to award a medal and was
                    resoundingly booed. The look on his face was
                    priceless; it had all been worth it, almost.</p>

                  <p>Admittedly, living in Stratford during the games
                    was at times both tedious and alarming. The station
                    became an impenetrable knot of visitors and
                    paramilitary police, and Westfield was clogged by a
                    fatberg of witless tourists. Meanwhile University
                    College London was trying to evict an entire
                    housing estate to build an eastern campus on its
                    ruins – a scheme that thankfully came to nothing,
                    after a spirited campaign by the residents – and
                    Anish Kapoor’s red steel prolapse reared on the
                    skyline. It was only a small consolation that we
                    were regularly treated to the sight of off-duty
                    athletes roaming the streets, like nylon-clad
                    gazelles escaped from a game reserve. They even
                    crossed the ring road to the old part of town:
                    thrillingly, I once spotted Louis Smith visiting
                    the Caribbean restaurant on the ground floor of our
                    apartment block. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>But the athletes didn’t hang around, and we were
                    left with something less aesthetically pleasing
                    altogether. The Olympic park, now renamed after her
                    majesty, turned out to be a representation of her
                    kingdom in miniature: a post-apocalyptic Disneyland
                    where Mad Max meets the Teletubbies, with wobbly
                    green protuberances undulating among acres of
                    tarmac. Perhaps it’s unfair to pass judgment at
                    this stage; the place is still a building site, and
                    will be for years to come.</p>

                  <p>The stadium is currently fenced off – it’s
                    being circumcised to prepare it for occupation by
                    West Ham United FC – and Boris has recently
                    proclaimed the establishment of an
                    “Olympicopolis” next to the aquatic centre,
                    with hopes of enticing outposts of the V&amp;A
                    museum, UCL and other cultural institutions. The
                    media centre is being turned into – hold on to
                    your lunch – “Here East: a world-leading
                    creative and digital cluster and London’s home
                    for making.” Despite feeling provisional and
                    patchy, on sunny days the park is full of young
                    families all clearly having a whale of a time. But
                    then, faced with the opportunity of a picnic in a
                    litter strewn lay-by, the Dunkirk spirit of the
                    British has always been irrepressible.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, the fringes of the park are
                    increasingly hemmed-in by huge and hideous
                    developer-designed towers cashing in on the Olympic
                    effect. The ones on the high street, with names
                    like “Halo” and “Stratosphere”, are
                    garlanded with balconies looking onto the
                    smog-filled canyon outside. I’ve never seen
                    anyone sitting out on these balconies – why would
                    you, it’s a horrible view – but they weren’t
                    designed to appeal to their residents, rather to
                    overseas investors. Ikea’s property arm is
                    building a huge mixed-use development south of the
                    high street, and a red-sheathed ziggurat has been
                    put up next to Westfield, full of overseas students
                    being battery-farmed for rent.</p>

                  <p>Inside the park, the former athletes’ village
                    – which was sold to the Qataris at a knock-down
                    price after the games – is now hilariously called
                    East Village. It’s a sterile grid of apartment
                    blocks surrounding gated courtyards. Some of these
                    buildings are clad with cast panels representing
                    scenes from the Elgin marbles (Mussolini might have
                    approved, but wouldn’t something from Olympia

                  Stratford East has long been a cultural focus for the
                  suburb, and is close to the redevelopment zone.

                  <p>People are beginning to move in to the area, and
                    I’m sure it’s a nice enough place, if you live
                    in abject terror of all the things that make cities
                    worthwhile. But whether all these new homes will
                    benefit existing residents is another question:
                    while house prices in Stratford seem relatively
                    unaffected by the games, especially when compared
                    to neighbouring Hackney, the amount of affordable
                    housing – and its degree of affordability –
                    seems unlikely to do much to alleviate the
                    borough’s housing shortage. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Some bits of Stratford did change for the better
                    during the Games. On the fringe of the park,
                    forming a not entirely successful bridge to the
                    impoverished streets of Leyton, is Chobham Academy,
                    a grand new school which cost £33m. Its
                    architecture might not be to all tastes, or indeed
                    to many, but its generosity is not to be sniffed at
                    in these straitened times, and the space-age atrium
                    makes some fancy hotels look distinctly shabby in
                    comparison. Meanwhile, a vacant lot on the square
                    by my apartment was filled with a small campus
                    shared by Birkbeck and the University of East
                    London. Designed by the architectural firm Make,
                    it’s nothing special to look at either but it
                    does bring an educational presence into the centre
                    of town: a welcome move, not least because the
                    local library had been shut for refurbishment
                    shortly before I moved in. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Outside the library a boulder commemorates poet
                    Gerard Manley Hopkins, who was improbably enough a
                    local boy. It had originally been embellished with
                    some lines from his Wreck of the Deutschland:
                    “Loathed for a love men knew in them/ banned by
                    the land of their birth/ Rhine refused them/ Thames
                    would ruin them …’ This sentiment felt
                    particularly poignant in Newham, where ethnic
                    minorities are in the majority; even more
                    poignantly, the plaque had been prised off for
                    scrap metal leaving the monument just a mute stone
                    outside the shuttered library. It didn’t seem
                    like a good sign.</p>

                  <p>When the building finally reopened, I went in for
                    a look around. The collection of books was
                    depressingly scanty, as they usually are in
                    libraries these days, but the space was not
                    unpleasant and clearly popular. Even better was the
                    conversation I overheard between two teenagers
                    studying there. One was explaining to his friend:
                    “The church is just bullshit fam, it’s all
                    about property and money.” The library was still
                    doing its job – and the Hopkins poem had been
                    restored to its rock.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>I would have liked to have stayed on in Stratford.
                    I wanted the aquatic centre to be my local pool:
                    after putting up with all the faff and fanfare of
                    the games, that only seemed fair. But London’s
                    rental market discourages settling down, and I
                    moved out of the area in the autumn of 2012. I’ve
                    been back a few times since, including a trip to
                    the aquatic centre shortly after it opened to the
                    public. When you get over the confusing anticlimax
                    of having to enter via a small side door, and when
                    you get used to the spooky emptiness of the place,
                    the building is, unquestionably, an impressive
                    place to swim. Lying on your back, drifting beneath
                    the biomorphic bulge of the wooden-slatted ceiling,
                    is perhaps what being keel-hauled feels like. After
                    going through the Olympics together, Stratford and
                    I know that feeling well.<br/>

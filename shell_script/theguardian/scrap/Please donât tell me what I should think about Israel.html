                  <p>What a strange, Alice-through-the-looking-glass
                    time it is to be a liberal American Jew in Britain.
                    When I was growing up in New York, it was a given
                    that one supported Israel. Israel, like America,
                    was a country made from desperate immigrants. It
                    was where my great-grandmother lived after seeing
                    two of her sons go to the concentration camps, and
                    where the memorial for my great-uncle Jakob, who
                    was murdered in Auschwitz, was erected. Israel was
                    the Holocaust’s happy ending, and you only have
                    to look at Hollywood to know how much America loves
                    simple happy endings. Israel = good, Israel’s
                    enemies = evil antisemites. But to be honest, I
                    always resented this. I dislike being told what to
                    think, or people making lazy assumptions about
                    where my loyalties should lie.</p>

                  <p>America’s devoted support for Israel is well
                    known, and increasingly is regarded by Europe with
                    the same kind of disgusted bafflement with which it
                    views the US relationship with guns. This week it
                    was reported in this paper that it’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/hollywood-divided-gaza-support-israel-backlash" title="">“unthinkable” in Hollywood</a> to
                    criticise Israel (that pesky Jewish mafia –
                    displease them and they’ll force-feed you matzos
                    until you explode). The Jewish Journal <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/with_israel_is_at_war_silence_is_golden" title="">chided high-profile Jews in Hollywood</a>,
                    including Steven Spielberg, for failing to make
                    their feelings about the Gaza conflict known, as
                    though anyone gives a flying hamantasch what
                    Spielberg thinks about Gaza.</p>

                  <p>So that’s America. And now we turn to Britain,
                    where I now live, and where, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/roger-cohen-why-americans-see-israel-the-way-they-do.html" title="">as Roger Cohen wrote</a> in the New York
                    Times recently, “not having a negative opinion of
                    Israel is tantamount to not having a conscience”.
                    This week’s most glaring example of this
                    mentality comes courtesy of the Tricycle Theatre in
                    Kilburn, north London, which demonstrated thinking
                    so nervy and so potentially hypocritical that at
                    least <a href="http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2014/08/07/have-the-tricycle-theatre-broken-the-law-by-refusing-to-host-the-jewish-film-festival/" title="">one legal expert said</a> it “may well
                    count as unlawful discrimination.”</p>

                  <p>The Tricycle, which has hosted the Jewish Film
                    Festival for the past eight years, told the
                    festival’s organisers that they could not hold it
                    this year if the festival accepted financing – of
                    the token amount of £1,400 – from the Israeli
                    embassy, as it always has done before. Fine – but
                    if the theatre doesn’t want to risk accusations
                    of bigotry, it needs to be consistent. Only two
                    months ago, it hosted the London Asian Film
                    Festival, partially financed by the Indian
                    government, and this was apparently of no concern,
                    despite India’s not exactly perfect human rights
                    record.</p>

                  <p>Pointing out that the theatre accepted a £725,000
                    grant from the Arts Council – which in turn comes
                    from a government whose stance on Israel was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/05/lady-warsi-resigns-government-gaza-stance" title="">described this week as “morally
                    indefensible”</a> by one of its own ministers –
                    is almost too easy. A person connected to the
                    theatre told me the difference is that these
                    grants, the Indian and British ones, came from the
                    cultural arm of the governments concerned, whereas
                    the Israeli one is very much connected to
                    Israel’s embassy – plus India is not at this
                    time engaged in a conflict (though this argument
                    works less well with regard to the British money).</p>

                  <p>But more complex issues were to come. The theatre
                    asked to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/06/-sp-tricycle-theatre-row-is-cultural-isolation-ever-right" title="">view all the festival’s films in
                    advance</a> “to approve their content”, a
                    request that even it conceded was tantamount to
                    censorship. The theatre also told the organisers
                    that it would happily host the festival – if they
                    refused the embassy’s money and accepted
                    reimbursement from the theatre, as though money was
                    ever the issue. That the theatre’s artistic
                    director, Indhu Rubasingham, said she <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/theatre-director-indhu-rubasingham-i-just-didnt-want-to-take-sides-in-a-very-emotional-passionate-situation-9651159.html?origin=internalSearch" title="">made this offer to keep the Tricycle
                    “politically neutral”</a> – as though asking
                    Jews to&nbsp;renounce Israel could ever be a
                    neutral act – reminds me how very far away I am
                    from the States. We’re not in Kansas any more,
                    Toto.</p>

                  <p>Clearly, a film festival being cancelled is not on
                    a par with civilian deaths. But it says something
                    very telling about certain lazily left-ish
                    attitudes towards Israel in this country, not least
                    because the Tricycle is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival/edinburgh-festival-2014-israeli-show-pulled-by-the-underbelly-after-propalestinian-protests-9640967.html" title="">not the only theatre in Britain to cancel
                    a Jewish event</a>: a theatre company from
                    Jerusalem was forced not to perform in Edinburgh
                    after protests, and a show featuring dancers from
                    Ben Gurion University is also being targeted.
                    Meanwhile, the London Palestine Action group <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/uav-factory-protest-drones-palestinian-gaza" title="">protests outside factories in this country
                    </a>that allegedly manufacture weapons for drones
                    for Israel. At least that protest is logical,
                    unlike those who congratulate themselves for
                    shutting down Jewish cultural events. Things have
                    come to a pretty pass when a liberal American Jew
                    finds clearer thinking among a Palestinian
                    liberation group than those who run theatres a few
                    miles from her home.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/07/antisemitism-rise-europe-worst-since-nazis" title="">Jon Henley wrote beautifully</a> in the
                    Guardian on Friday about the rise in antisemitic
                    attacks in Europe. Proud as I am to work for a
                    paper that covers the atrocities in Palestine so
                    diligently, it is outrageous that it took this
                    country’s liberal media so long to report on this
                    issue. It is infuriating that the liberal factions
                    in both countries in which I have nationality
                    insist on taking such a slanted, kneejerk view of
                    Israel. Just as the pro-Israel sentiment in the US
                    so often elides into prejudice against Muslims, so
                    the anti-Israel one in Britain slips all too
                    quickly into antisemitism.</p>

                  <p>Jews are not Israel (something liberal Jews have
                    been saying for years) but nobody – not a London
                    theatre, not even Steven Spielberg – has the
                    right to tell them what to think about it, or to
                    ask them to prove their good Jewish credentials by
                    either supporting or condemning it. Watch yourself,
                    Europe. Some of your roots are showing.</p>

              <p>At least three civilians have been killed and another
                10 wounded in overnight shelling of the main rebel
                stronghold in eastern <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine" title="More from the Guardian on Ukraine">Ukraine</a>
                besieged by government forces, officials said.</p>

              <p>Local people said a rebel rocket launcher recently
                seen in the area may have been the target.</p>

              <p>The Donetsk city council said four apartment buildings
                in the southern part of the city were damaged by
                artillery. Shocked residents gathered around in the
                morning; some left flowers on the pavement to
                commemorate the victims.</p>

              <p>"Nina, my godmother, was blown into pieces right in
                front of the apartment. They were only able to identify
                her by her dressing gown," said 55-year old Yevgeny
                Isayev. He pointed at a crater left by a projectile
                that landed next to the building's entrance.</p>

              <p>Another resident, Marina Barsuk, 53, said the shelling
                came a few days after rebels had positioned a Grad
                rocket launcher near the apartment building and fired
                at Ukrainian positions. She and other residents
                believed the shelling came from the Ukrainian side in
                retribution.</p>

              <p>Such exchanges of artillery and rocket barrage have
                raised the death toll among civilians as the Ukrainian
                forces have closed in on the main rebel bastion.</p>

              <p>In an ominous signal that fighting is likely to
                escalate further, a top rebel leader, Alexander
                Zakharchenko, boasted on Thursday about seizing 18 Grad
                systems from the Ukrainian military.</p>

              <p>Government forces and the rebels use the same
                Soviet-made Grad – Russian for hail – launchers,
                which fire unguided rockets at a distance of up to 12
                miles. Their accuracy is very poor, making collateral
                damage from shelling populated areas inevitable.</p>

              <p>Ukrainian officials have adamantly denied that
                government forces were shelling populated areas, but
                witness testimony has pointed to the contrary.</p>

              <p>Explosions were also heard elsewhere in Donetsk
                overnight, but there was no immediate word about
                casualties there.</p>

              <p>Ukrainian troops routed pro-Russian insurgents from
                smaller towns in the region this month and have
                encircled Donetsk, where fighting has crept closer to
                the city centre. The city council said it was working
                to keep transport services running and to repair gas
                networks in apartment buildings. An estimated 300,000
                of the city's million residents have fled.</p>

              <p>The insurgency in mostly Russian-speaking eastern
                Ukraine flared up in April following Moscow's
                annexation of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea" title="More from the Guardian on Crimea">Crimea</a> in
                response to the removal of Ukraine's pro-<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia" title="More from the Guardian on Russia">Russia</a>
                former president. Ukraine and western countries have
                accused Moscow of backing the mutiny with weapons and
                soldiers.</p>

              <p>The west also accused Russia of providing the
                insurgents with surface-to-air missiles that may have
                been used to shoot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger
                jet over rebel-held territory on 17 July, killing all
                298 people on board. The Russian government has
                repeatedly denied all those charges.</p>

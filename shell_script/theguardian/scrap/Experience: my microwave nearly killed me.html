<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>It was the week of my 32nd birthday last September.
                I&nbsp;had been at a friend's house on Saturday night
                for some cake and cava. I came home to my flat&nbsp;in
                Pimlico and went more or less straight to bed. I didn't
                wake up until the Sunday, when I&nbsp;found myself in
                intensive care.</p>

              <p>I have no memory of it, but I'm told that just after
                11pm, about half an hour after I'd gone to bed, my
                microwave had exploded. It was empty, plugged in and
                switched on at the mains, as usual. The washing
                machine, which was beneath it, caught fire from the
                explosion. The fire spread. The firefighters found me
                in the hallway – I must have tried to escape. I had
                passed out because of the carbon monoxide.</p>

              <p>They later told me that neighbours had seen smoke
                coming out of the patio door, and raised the alarm.
                It&nbsp;took five fire engines five hours to&nbsp;put
                it out, even though it's just a small one-bedroom flat.
                Paramedics arrived and resuscitated me in the
                ambulance: my heart stopped twice.</p>

              <p>They took me to intensive care, where I was in and out
                of a coma for&nbsp;three days. It was like lying in a
                black room, just waiting. I remember feeling shocked
                because I felt weightless, but also feeling very
                peaceful. It was like being underwater. A policeman
                was&nbsp;sent to my parents' house in Swansea to inform
                them what had happened. They were told that I was
                probably going to die, and rushed straight to London
                where the hospital staff told them I would live but
                that I would have brain damage and need 24-hour nursing
                care.</p>

              <p>Thankfully, they were wrong. On&nbsp;the Friday I woke
                up for a few seconds. I remember feeling outraged that
                I was naked with all these people around me. I couldn't
                talk properly and every time I&nbsp;opened my mouth a
                smell of smoke came out – but I kept trying to shout:
                "Where are my clothes?" When I&nbsp;woke up properly on
                the Sunday the first thing I saw was my parents, who
                looked as if someone had died.</p>

              <p>I understood that I was in hospital. At first I
                thought that the fire was my fault because I always
                smoke half a cigarette before bed to send me to sleep.
                I felt incredibly guilty until the firefighters told me
                it was definitely the microwave. I was moved to a
                respiratory ward, as the carbon monoxide had damaged my
                lungs. I didn't suffer any burns, as the flames hadn't
                reached me.</p>

              <p>After nine days in hospital, I&nbsp;moved back to
                Swansea with my parents for two weeks. That was tough.
                I am very independent, so I&nbsp;found it hard letting
                them do basic things. I was so tired I couldn't climb
                stairs. Lifting a fork to my mouth was an effort. By
                the second week, I&nbsp;was getting my strength back
                slowly, and I was then well enough to move in with a
                friend in London.</p>

              <p>I went back to work as a mental health nurse after a
                month. My family said it was too soon, but
                I&nbsp;thought I was fine. I didn't like telling people
                what had happened in case they thought I was being a
                drama queen. But on the second day my manager asked me
                how I was and I just burst into tears. I wasn't ready.</p>

              <p>Six weeks after the fire, I went back to my flat for
                the first time. It&nbsp;was a shell. Everything smelled
                terrible. I&nbsp;salvaged a few books.
                The&nbsp;insurance organised the rebuilding, and it
                took seven months to do all the repairs. I&nbsp;moved
                back in at the end of April last year. That was an
                awful time. It&nbsp;wasn't losing all my stuff, but
                coming to terms with nearly dying. I&nbsp;felt as if
                I&nbsp;was at risk all the time, as&nbsp;if the
                sky&nbsp;might fall on my head. I&nbsp;kept
                my&nbsp;door unlocked and I got rid of all&nbsp;my
                electrical goods. I&nbsp;couldn't see&nbsp;the point of
                life, because I realised that I&nbsp;could lose it all
                in just one moment.</p>

              <p>I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder
                and I had counselling for four months, which really
                helped. Gradually, I learned to change the way I
                approached things. I began to think that, in case I
                died in the next five minutes, I should make the next
                four minutes and 59 seconds count. I made my flat my
                home again and even started to be able to laugh about
                it. I eventually realised how impractical life was
                without a fridge and a washing machine, so
                I&nbsp;started using them again, but I do switch off
                all electrical goods at the mains every night. I will
                never get another microwave, though. People tell me
                they're unhealthy anyway.</p>

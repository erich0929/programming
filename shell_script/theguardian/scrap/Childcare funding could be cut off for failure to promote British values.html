              <p>Parents will have government funding for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/childcare" title="More from the Guardian on                 Childcare">childcare</a> cut off if their <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/children" title="More from the Guardian on                 Children">children</a>'s nannies or nurseries fail to
                "actively promote fundamental British values",
                including democracy and liberty, under measures
                announced by the Department for Education.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan" title="More from the Guardian on Nicky Morgan">Nicky
                Morgan</a>, the education secretary, said the move was
                designed to protect young children from extremist
                views. But the announcement was greeted with dismay by
                childcare practitioners and experts.</p>

              <p>"This is a surprising issue for the education
                secretary to pick for her first intervention in early
                years policy given that there is no evidence as far as
                I am aware of extremist values being promoted in
                nurseries," said Beatrice Merrick, the chief executive
                of the <a href="http://www.early-education.org.uk/" title="">British Association for Early Childhood
                Education</a>.</p>

              <p>"The idea of distinctive British values is quite
                elusive for any age group and it would be hard to claim
                that there is a British monopoly on any of the values
                we might be talking about. Using such language is
                dangerous in implying we are somehow morally superior
                to other nations and cultures. Surely that isn't the
                message we want to teach our youngest children?"</p>

              <p>Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Pre‑school
                Learning Alliance, which represents 14,000 childcare
                providers in England, said his organisation welcomed
                the spirit of the government's announcement but
                questioned the usefulness for young children.</p>

              <p>"We cannot see how stipulating 'British values' or the
                state of 'Britishness' adds anything that could ever be
                meaningful to the experiences of young children,"he
                said. "</p>

              <p>Practitioners are likely to struggle to think of
                anything that needs to be taught to young children to
                achieve British values specifically – their focus
                will always be on providing a rich and positive
                experience in all areas. Life values are more important
                to develop for a two-year-old, not a limited view of
                culture and life."</p>

              <p>The DfE's statement said <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/earlyyearseducation" title="More from the Guardian on Early years                 education">early years education</a> providers "will be
                expected to teach children about fundamental British
                values in an age-appropriate way. For children in the
                early years, this will be about learning right from
                wrong, learning to take turns and share, and
                challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes."</p>

              <p>But the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/school-and-early-years-finance-england-regulations-2014" title="">new regulations are more specific</a>, saying
                local authorities will be empowered to cut off state
                funding – including the 15 hours of childcare funding
                a week for two- to four-year-olds – to any provider
                that "does not actively promote the fundamental British
                values of democracy, the rule of law, individual
                liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with
                different faiths and beliefs".</p>

              <p>Morgan said: "There can be no place for extremist
                views anywhere in the education system. The changes we
                are making today will ensure that all early years
                providers and schools are aligned with the need to
                protect children from views that are considered
                extreme."</p>

              <p>According to the DfE, Ofsted will be required to
                inspect early years providers against the new criteria.
                The regulations will bring early years education into
                line with similar changes to primary and secondary
                schools, introduced by Morgan's predecessor Michael
                Gove after the Trojan Horse affair, in which Islamist
                infiltration was alleged in a group of schools in
                Birmingham.</p>

              <p>The rules also include sanctions against the teaching
                of creationism as scientific fact or promotion of
                climate change denial by childcare providers, although
                the Department for Education stressed that religious
                education was still allowed.</p>

              <p>The regulations allow local authorities to cut off
                funds to any provider that "promotes, as
                evidence-based, views and theories which are contrary
                to established scientific or historical evidence and
                explanations", such as creationism. A DfE spokesperson
                said religious education would still be allowed, so
                long as it was not presented as scientific fact.</p>

              <p>Andrew Copson, the chief executive of the British
                Humanist Association, said: "It is vital that every
                young person receives a broad and balanced education,
                including teaching evolution as the only evidence-based
                view of how life came to be."</p>

              <p>The government funds 15 hours of childcare a week for
                all three- and four-year-olds, and for two-year-olds
                from deprived households. The 15 hours can be used at
                schools with nursery places, or to pay for places at
                private nurseries or for Ofsted-registered providers
                such as nannies or au pairs.</p>

              <p>Morgan said: "One of the most important roles of the
                education system is that it should prepare young people
                for life in modern Britain. I am clear that public
                money should not be used to support any school or early
                years provider that does not support this aim because
                it seeks to promote ideas and teachings than run
                counter to fundamental British values."</p>

              <p>Kevin Courtney, the deputy general secretary of the
                National Union of Teachers, said it was disappointing
                that extremism was the focus of Morgan's first policy
                announcement.</p>

              <p>"Asking Ofsted to inspect how well nurseries are
                teaching 'fundamental British values' does not appear
                to offer anything new for children and will concern all
                those who seek to promote community engagement,"
                Courtney said.</p>

                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>At least 10 rockets have been fired from Gaza
                    towards Israel after Hamas refused to extend a
                    72-hour ceasefire that expired at 8am local time on
                    Friday.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Israel said it had made no response to “multiple
                    attacks”. At least one rocket appeared to have
                    fallen short, landing in Gaza itself.</p>

                  <p>It was unclear whether Hamas or the independent
                    but allied group Palestinian Islamic Jihad was
                    responsible for launching the rockets.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Hamas officials in Gaza on Thursday threatened to
                    restart hostilities if their demands were not met
                    in indirect negotiations with Israel that have
                    continued in Cairo for most of the week. As Friday
                    dawned there was no word of progress.</p>

                  <p>The Palestinian delegation in Cairo have demanded
                    an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza must be lifted
                    and Israel must free about 100 prisoners to secure
                    a further truce. Israel insists that Hamas must
                    disarm, which officials from the Palestinian group
                    have said is “inconceivable”.</p>

                  <p>The expiration of the official ceasefire will
                    raise fears of a further bout of intense fighting
                    in a conflict in which nearly 1,900 Palestinians,
                    most of them civilians, have died along with 64
                    Israeli soldiers. More than 3,000 rockets have been
                    fired from Gaza into Israel in recent weeks. Most
                    of those headed for inhabited areas were shot down
                    but three civilians in Israel have been killed. A
                    surge in rockets fired from Gaza prompted Israel to
                    launch air strikes almost a month ago.</p>

                  <p>Statements by Hamas officials in Gaza were echoed
                    by members of the Palestinian negotiating team in
                    Cairo on Thursday. “If the Israelis don’t agree
                    we will go back and fight through the tunnels,”
                    one said.</p>

                  <p>The discovery of dozens of tunnels between Gaza
                    and Israel, which could be used to mount attacks to
                    kill or kidnap civilians and soldiers, was cited as
                    the main reason Israel sent ground forces into Gaza
                    after days of aerial bombardment last month.</p>

                  <p>The destruction of the tunnels discovered by
                    Israeli troops was also given as the reason for
                    ending the ground operation. The new threat,
                    however, suggests further tunnels may exist.</p>

                  <p>“All the scenarios are available. The
                    Palestinian resistance continues and we will take
                    actions depending on the results of the
                    negotiations. If Israel does not respond to the
                    demands of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian
                    resistance can resume its activity,” said a
                    delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

                  <p>The joint Palestinian delegation, formed from
                    leaders of most Palestinian political factions, was
                    meeting Egyptian officials on Thursday night. The
                    ceasefire declared on Monday night was the latest
                    in a series of attempts to halt the war.</p>

                  <p>The gap between the demands of a Palestinian
                    delegation, which includes Hamas, smaller factions
                    and the Palestinian Authority, and those of Israel
                    remains substantial.</p>

                  <p>Israel is reluctant to lift the eight-year
                    blockade of Gaza, the principal demand of Hamas, as
                    it believes any substantial easing of restrictions
                    could strengthen the Islamist organisation both
                    politically and militarily.</p>

                  <p>Ihab al-Ghussein, the deputy information minister
                    of Hamas, said on Thursday: “At 8am [Friday] our
                    military brigades say they will continue the
                    struggle if we do not get our demands. We have
                    nothing to lose.”</p>

                  <p>Israeli officials said Hamas had rejected their
                    offer to extend the ceasefire. Hamas did not
                    confirm or deny the claim.</p>

                  <p>In Gaza City on Thursday, Hamas and allied
                    factions organised a rally in support of the
                    Palestinian delegation in Cairo.</p>

                  <p>Thousands listened to chants praising the
                    Palestinian military wings for their victories and
                    to speeches calling for “victory in the political
                    battle, as in the military battle”.</p>

                  <p>Though most in Gaza are supportive of Hamas, at
                    least in public, a failure to secure any
                    significant concessions in the talks could
                    undermine its popularity.</p>

                  <p>Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
                    (PLO) of President Mahmoud Abbas have been
                    officially negotiating as one in Cairo.</p>

                  <p>In April Hamas signed a unity agreement with the
                    PLO, which is dominated by the Fatah faction and
                    had been at odds with Hamas for decades. The
                    reconciliation saw the former rivals setting up a
                    consensus government of independent technocrats
                    that took office in June, ending seven years of
                    separate administrations.</p>

                  <p>In 2006 Hamas won Palestinian elections, taking de
                    facto control of Gaza the following year. Binyamin
                    Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has compared
                    the group to Boko Haram, the Nigerian extremist
                    movement, and the Islamic State (formerly known as
                    the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or Isis), an
                    al-Qaida splinter infamous for its brutality.
                    Previously Netanyahu has refused to co-operate with
                    the unity government because it included Hamas.</p>

                  <p>One area offering some potential for agreement is
                    the possible opening of the Egyptian border
                    crossing into Gaza at Rafah.</p>

                  <p>Israel wants Abbas’s security forces to retake
                    control of Gaza and deploy on the Palestinian side
                    of the Rafah crossing, and for international aid to
                    be disbursed through Abbas.</p>

                  <p>Egypt has kept the Rafah crossing closed since the
                    army’s overthrow in July 2013 of the Islamist
                    president Mohamed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood
                    movement was a close ally of Hamas.</p>

                  <p>Relations between Egypt and Hamas have collapsed
                    since Morsi was ousted. The new regime in Egypt,
                    one of only two Arab countries that have a peace
                    treaty with Israel, says it has destroyed more than
                    1,600 cross-border smuggling tunnels leading from
                    Gaza into the Sinai peninsula.</p>

                  <p>Israel has previously made some concessions on the
                    blockade, easing restrictions on imports of food
                    and construction materials in 2010 following the
                    international outcry over a botched Israeli raid on
                    a Gaza-bound flotilla that left 10 Turks dead. Some
                    restrictions were further eased after the last war
                    between Hamas and Israel in Gaza in 2012.</p>

                  <p>Ghussein, the Hamas minister, said: “We are not
                    asking for miracles, just stopping the war,
                    implementing past agreements, lifting the siege. We
                    have to show support for our delegation and ask
                    them to be firm about our demands. There will be no
                    white flag.”</p>

                  <p>Up to 30% of Gaza’s 1.8 million people have been
                    displaced by the recent fighting and an estimated
                    65,000 people are homeless. About double that
                    number are sheltering in UN schools converted to
                    shelters during the war.</p>

                  <p>The death toll in the conflict continues to rise
                    as bodies are retrieved from ruined homes around
                    Gaza. About 150 patients remain in intensive care,
                    health officials say, out of 9,806 people treated.
                    More than 400 children have been killed.</p>

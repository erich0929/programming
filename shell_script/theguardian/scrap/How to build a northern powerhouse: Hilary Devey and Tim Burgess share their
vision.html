              <h2>Hilary Devey <br/>
                CBE Award-winning entrepreneur</h2>

              <p>I was born in Bolton, built a business in the
                Midlands, and live in the south, which affords me a
                unique perspective when it comes to knowing the
                significance of the north in terms of both British
                business and culture. The fact that my perspective
                seems unique – and that we are not overwhelmed with
                entrepreneurial voices from the north, once the
                crucible of British industry – is indicative of a
                number of problems. Two issues need to be addressed:
                one practical; one attitudinal.</p>

              <p>Firstly, the existing northern public transport system
                is a shambles. This needs to be addressed in tandem
                with any new high-speed rail development, otherwise we
                are simply creating more&nbsp;problems.</p>

              <p>Secondly, the north is often considered by southerners
                to be another country, and the feeling is mutual. To
                the frustration of many in the north, the British media
                focuses on London, and there is a corresponding drain
                of talent southwards. Pride and confidence in the north
                – on the part of&nbsp;both northerners and
                southerners – is key to making it a powerhouse. For
                too long we have had two societies running in parallel,
                and our strength must come through unity.</p>

              <p>Never mind exchange programmes for schoolkids to
                France. I want to see a social programme that begins at
                school age to ensure that children in London know about
                Leeds (and vice versa), as much as they do about Lyon
                or Lille.</p>

              <p>As with cities, I would love to see some form of
                business-twinning between northern and southern
                companies. Without mutual respect and cooperation, no
                amount of infrastructure development will change the
                status quo."</p>

              <h2>Tim Burgess <br/>
                Singer</h2>

              <p>A northern powerhouse sounds like a description of a
                Giant Haystacks-style wrestler or something Eddie
                Waring might say about a rugby league player in the
                70s. It kind of seems a bit stuck in the past – some
                big chuffing coal-munching traction steam thing we'd be
                given while London runs on some silent future energy.</p>

              <p>Osborne and Cameron were "oop north" on Monday talking
                about it. They always look a bit scared – like
                they've accidentally ended up in the tough bit of town
                – when they're in front of some workers in a treacle
                factory in a gritty part of the country that they're
                not that familiar with.</p>

              <p>They kind of bring their cleansing, efficient business
                sensibilities where they're not asked for. High-speed
                links&nbsp;between Manchester and Leeds?&nbsp;It only
                takes an hour. They have&nbsp;the air of two berks off
                The Apprentice hustling something they just invented
                that they know nobody needs. Chuck in Nick Clegg –
                lost in a black people carrier somewhere shouting into
                a switched-off phone in&nbsp;the palm of his hand –
                and the image is complete.</p>

              <p>Sheffield and Leeds are still getting over the last
                bright ideas for business that a Conservative prime
                minister had for their region – I've been to
                Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds in the last few weeks
                and they seem to be thriving on the merits and efforts
                of&nbsp;people who actually live there. I'm sure that
                everyone would welcome money, investment and help for
                the future but maybe not from some snake-oil salesmen
                who are just passing&nbsp;through.</p>

              <h2>Wayne Hemingway <br/>
                Designer and retail expert</h2>

              <p>The idea of a northern powerhouse is one that's been
                promoted for a long time, particularly by our finest
                planner Sir Peter Hall. It's just that it's fallen on
                deaf ears. Whether a government has the ability to
                deliver it is another matter. London needs to have real
                competition in the UK – ideas, creativity, club
                culture, music and film aren't owned by the capital but
                infrastructure is so heavily focused on the south, it's
                created a lopsided economy. Look at Germany – it's so
                much stronger because it has a set of regional cities
                with strong industries that give people equal
                opportunities to live and work.</p>

              <p>I can see the media mischievously playing with the
                idea of this being one big super northern city
                stretching from coast to coast, which is a nonsense and
                misses the point. Having amazing public transport will
                connect this string of pearls – Liverpool,
                Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and beyond – and that
                can only be a good thing.</p>

              <p>I use public transport a lot, I would never dream of
                going up north in a car, and it only takes two hours or
                so to get to Manchester from London, but it can then
                take you just as long to travel a fraction of the
                distance to another town. Try getting the 26 miles from
                Blackburn, a town of 150,000 people, to Manchester; it
                can take almost 90 minutes and it shouldn't be like
                that. <em>As told to Nosheen Iqbal</em></p>

              <h2>Phil Redmond <br/>
                TV producer and founder of Mersey Television</h2>

              <p>One of the great advantages of being born, bred and
                surviving in the north is that you are forced into
                accepting a global perspective.</p>

              <p>On Monday the chancellor was encouraging the north to
                create a powerhouse to counterweight London. While his
                argument was superficially persuasive it contained
                three basic flaws. The first is the idea that large
                cities are needed for innovation and growth. The second
                is that the ability to travel between cities is in
                itself an economic driver. Try telling those things to
                the 40,000 or so folks that were in Cupertino when
                Steve Jobs set up shop. Or the 30,000 people in Menlo
                Park who watched Sergey Brin's and Larry Page's Google
                start-up.</p>

              <p>The third flaw was not accepting that cliches only
                exist because they are true. The north-south divide
                needs to be recognised for what it is. A simple clash
                of historical perspectives. And priorities.</p>

              <p>Given a choice, people prefer to live and work in the
                same environment. And, usually, where they live. It is
                people that make a difference. People that make cities.
                Hence the consequent rise of Silicon Valley and,
                perhaps ironically, the rise of Ukip and the Scottish
                romantic dream of Independence. People actually don't
                want to be a London counterweight. Not understanding
                this is what continually fuels this situation.</p>

              <h2>Marina Lewycka <br/>
                Novelist</h2>

              <p>Who doesn't want to live in a "powerhouse"? It sounds
                lovely – glitzy skyscrapers looming above the
                council&nbsp;estates, coffee shops and art galleries
                springing up where slag heaps&nbsp;used to be.</p>

              <p>And all this would be achieved by a railway line or
                two? And electing a showman with a funny hairdo to run
                the city? Bring it on! But before we get&nbsp;seduced
                by this vision, let's stop and think.</p>

              <p>Sheffield used to be an economic powerhouse. In the
                days of coal and steel, you could see the flames from
                the blast furnaces leaping up beside the M1 as you
                drove north; work was hard for miners and steelworkers,
                but wages were good, transport and housing were cheap,
                the surrounding countryside was lovely, and there was a
                strong sense of community.</p>

              <p>This has all changed, not because local people have
                become lazy and feckless and too many foreigners have
                arrived; not even because of Margaret Thatcher. It has
                changed because our economy, like the&nbsp;whole of
                Europe, shifted away from manufacturing and toward
                finance and services, which are concentrated in London.</p>

              <p>It would be churlish to reject any initiative that
                would create more and better jobs for local people. The
                saddest thing about Sheffield today is&nbsp;the way
                that young people are sucked south in search of better
                opportunities. But the coalition government's track
                record (Yes, Nick Clegg, I'm talking about you too) on
                the local economy is dubious.</p>

              <p>One of their first acts in power was to cancel an
                £80m loan (not grant) to Sheffield Forgemasters to
                enable them to produce extra-large forgings for nuclear
                power stations, which will now&nbsp;probably be built
                in France, China or Japan.</p>

              <p>The austerity package will reduce by 50% Sheffield's
                grant from central Government by 2015/2016 costing each
                household £308, as compared with £87 in Windsor or

              <p>One of Sheffield's biggest "exports" is education:
                overseas students at our two excellent universities
                contribute £120m to the local economy. Thanks to
                heavy-handed application of government visa
                regulations, the number has declined nationally for the
                first time in years, and overseas students now take
                their brains and their money elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, our local utilities, which used to be tied
                into the local economy, are now all based overseas. I
                was quite taken aback to discover that the water in my
                taps comes all the way from the Cayman Islands.</p>

              <p>I'm all in favour of better transport – I use quite
                a bit of it myself – but Sheffield, although quite
                close to Manchester, is cut off by the beautiful but
                wild Pennines, where even the sheep look lost. I can
                see that building infrastructure will be great for some
                of the government's favourite entrepreneurs, but it's
                no substitute for investment in real industries and
                skills.</p>

              <p>I think the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/north-high-speed-train-line-george-osborne" title="">idea of HS3</a>, or certainly improving rails
                links across the north, is very positive. Going from
                Leeds to Manchester by train can take me almost as long
                as going to London - around two hours – and much
                longer if I go by car and it's congested. The prospect
                of elected mayors is certainly interesting. But I'm
                less worried about structure, more about quality.</p>

              <p>Manchester, for example, doesn't have an elected mayor
                but Richard Leese (Manchester City council leader since
                1996) and Howard Bernstein (chief executive of
                Manchester City council) are incredibly well thought
                of, and other places with elected mayors have operated
                less well. The boundaries we've got are fairly
                arbitrary (for instance, the line between Machester and
                Salford, or Manchester and Trafford) and we need to act
                with greater cooperation.</p>

              <p>One of the great things we have got are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/mar/15/science-policy1" title="">our universities</a> and I think the
                University of Manchester is a great example, with
                graphene and various other things. Yet still the
                majority of research funding goes into the south-east
                – that's something that could be relatively easily
                addressed. The vast majority of expenditure on
                transport has gone south too, with projects such as
                Crossrail. People would go anywhere to watch the
                national football team and having it in a fairly badly
                located Wembley is the sort of thing the government
                could look to change.</p>

              <p>The turning point in Manchester wasn't necessarily the
                IRA bomb, or even the Commonwealth Games. It was when
                Manchester bid for the Olympics Games. Although we lost
                – with all the stupid jokes about the shooting being
                in Moss Side and so on – it gave Mancunians a sense
                of pride. There were thousands of people celebrating in
                the street, even though we lost. We realised we weren't
                competing with Bradford or Birmingham or London for
                that matter, but Barcelona and Los Angeles and Sydney,
                and lots of global second cities. The Capital of
                Culture competition helped to transform Liverpool in
                2008, and hopefully it will have a positive effect in
                Hull.</p>

              <p>The government has made some positive moves in setting
                up things like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-targets-overseas-funds-with-new-inward-investment-body" title="">RIO (Regeneration Investment
                Organisation)</a>, which I think has started some good
                work. But I think more of that could happen.
                Regeneration almost finished with austerity, four or
                five years ago. There's much more still to do and I
                think some modest investment could make a huge
                difference. <em>As told to Bim Adewunmi</em></p>

              <p>Mary Anne Hobbs of BBC Radio 6 said to me the other
                day that we are on the edge of a cultural renaissance
                in Manchester. Twenty five million pounds is being
                spent on Home, an arts centre to rival the Southbank,
                directly facing where the Haçienda used to be. The
                British Film Institute archive is now held in
                Manchester at the newly refurbished Manchester Library,
                which opened a week or so ago. Media City has created
                an exodus of media folks from London. Whitworth Art
                Gallery has doubled in size and opens in October.</p>

              <p>Manchester is regrouping, financially and culturally.
                The space of Manchester has changed. There are
                Eritreans and Ethiopians here when there weren't 10
                years ago. But for me, as somebody from Lancashire,
                Manchester and other northern cities will only develop
                if they embrace the other cultures that exist there.
                Because it is those cultures that make it what it is.
                Toni Morrison wrote: "All paradises, all utopias are
                designed by who is not there, by the people who are not
                allowed in."</p>

              <p>It's really important that diversity is&nbsp;central
                to those processes of growth,&nbsp;otherwise they won't
                happen. We need to see our cities as Cosmopolitan,
                avant-garde challenges – to find new ways of being.
                People come to London and say, "Ooh, everybody's from
                everywhere." Well everybody <em>is</em> from
                everywhere. You need to embrace that rather than
                patronise it. <em>As told to Steve Rose</em></p>

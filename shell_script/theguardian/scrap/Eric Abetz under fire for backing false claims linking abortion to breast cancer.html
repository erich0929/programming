                  <p>A senior government minister, Eric Abetz, has
                    faced criticism from the Australian Medical
                    Association and the Breast Cancer Network of
                    Australia for giving credence to a debunked link
                    between abortion and breast cancer.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>The employment minister, who is also the
                    government’s leader in the Senate, said during a
                    television interview: “I think the studies, and I
                    think they date back from the 1950s, assert that
                    there is a link between abortion and breast
                    cancer.”</p>

                  <p>Abetz was defending his support for the upcoming
                    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/victorias-attorney-general-to-address-anti-abortion-and-anti-gay-campaigners">World
                    Congress of Families event</a> in Melbourne where
                    the speakers will include an American anti-abortion
                    campaigner and doctor, Angela Lanfranchi, who also
                    opposes use of the contraceptive pill.</p>

                  <p>But the World Health Organisation and leading
                    medical bodies have said there is no evidence of a
                    link, and the AMA and the Breast Cancer Network of
                    Australia described Abetz’s comments as
                    irresponsible because they could cause women
                    unnecessary concern.</p>

                  <p>The AMA president, Brian Owler, told Guardian
                    Australia: “I respect his right to have a view
                    about abortion and I recognise there’s a range of
                    views in the community … but what is
                    inappropriate is for a senior member of the
                    government to go on national television and use
                    this pseudoscience of these false claims that have
                    been put out by a group that is pushing a
                    particular ideology to spread that ideology.</p>

                  <p>“That is irresponsible and not the behaviour
                    we’d expect of a senior member of the
                    government.”</p>

                  <p>Abetz has since tried to hose down the
                    controversy, saying he “was cut off before being
                    able to acknowledge that Dr Angela Lanfranchi’s
                    views on this topic were not the accepted medical
                    view”.</p>

                  <p>“Media reports that I have drawn or believe
                    there is a link between abortion and breast cancer
                    are incorrect,” he said in a statement.</p>

                  <p>The senator said he did not endorse the views of
                    every speaker at the conference, but added that
                    Lanfranchi was a breast cancer surgeon and had
                    “the right to free speech in Australia”. “I
                    accept the AMA has a right to disagree with Dr
                    Lanfranchi’s views,” Abetz said.</p>

                  <p>The statement was designed to head off controversy
                    generated by the minister’s interview with <a href="http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project?psearch=Google">Ten’s
                    The Project</a> on Thursday night.</p>

                  <p>In the interview, Abetz said he was supporting the
                    World Congress of Families “based on their basic
                    views and beliefs that they support the traditional
                    view of marriage and that they are pro-life”.</p>

                  <p>“They are two values that I personally and,
                    might I add, many of our fellow Australians do hold
                    dear,” he said.</p>

                  <p>When asked by the panellist and Mamamia publisher
                    Mia Freedman whether he agreed with the
                    “factually incorrect statement” promoted by one
                    of the speakers that abortion led to breast cancer,
                    Abetz referred to studies dating from the 1950s
                    which “assert that there is a link”.</p>

                  <p>Freedman replied that it was “conclusively and
                    scientifically incorrect” in the same way that
                    the linking of vaccination to autism was incorrect.</p>

                  <p>Abetz: “Well, I don’t know what your
                    scientific expertise is to be able to run that
                    commentary; I confess that I don’t have the
                    scientific expertise.”</p>

                  <p>Freedman: “It’s not me, it’s the AMA.”</p>

                  <p>Abetz: “Well there are other organisations that
                    have differing views as some of these speakers are
                    clinical professors.”</p>

                  <p>The lead national cancer control agency, <a href="http://canceraustralia.gov.au/affected-cancer/cancer-types/breast-cancer/your-risk-and-breast-cancer/risk-factors/unproven-risk-factors">Cancer
                    Australia, states</a>: “Research has shown there
                    is no link between termination of pregnancy and
                    increased risk of breast cancer.”</p>

                  <p>The <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf">World
                    Health Organisation says</a>: “Sound
                    epidemiological data show no increased risk of
                    breast cancer for women following spontaneous or
                    induced abortion.”</p>

                  <p>The <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/abortion-miscarriage">US
                    National Cancer Institute said</a> a February 2003
                    workshop it convened of more than 100 of the
                    world’s leading experts who studied pregnancy and
                    breast cancer risk “concluded that having an
                    abortion or miscarriage does not increase a
                    woman’s subsequent risk of developing breast
                    cancer”.</p>

                  <p>“Considering the body of literature that has
                    been published since 2003, when NCI held this
                    extensive workshop on early reproductive events and
                    cancer, the evidence overall still does not support
                    early termination of pregnancy as a cause of breast
                    cancer,” it said.</p>

                  <p>An American College of Obstetricians and
                    Gynecologists committee <a href="http://www.acog.org/~/media/Committee%20Opinions/Committee%20on%20Gynecologic%20Practice/co434.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130601T0701301666">concluded
                    in 2009</a>: “Early studies of the relationship
                    between prior induced abortion and breast cancer
                    risk were methodologically flawed. More rigorous
                    recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship
                    between induced abortion and a subsequent increase
                    in breast cancer risk.”</p>

                  <p>The London-based Royal College of Obstetricians
                    and Gynaecologists <a href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-opinions/briefings-and-qas-/human-fertilisation-and-embryology-bill/brie-4">said
                    its literature review</a> found “no established
                    link between induced abortion or miscarriage and
                    development of breast cancer”.</p>

                  <p>The acting leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said
                    Abetz should apologise because his comments were
                    “an insult, not just to any woman who has
                    suffered breast cancer or who has had an abortion,
                    but to all women”.</p>

                  <p>“This is a government of old men who do not
                    share modern Australian values,” he said. “If
                    Senator Abetz accepts the science on this issue as
                    he now claims, he should commit to not attending
                    the World Congress of Families conference.”</p>

                  <p>Bandt said the prime minister, Tony Abbott, should
                    ensure his cabinet members, including the social
                    services minister, Kevin Andrews, did not attend
                    the conference.</p>

                  <p>Labor’s shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew
                    Leigh, told the ABC the Coalition’s views on
                    science “seem to reflect their lack of a science
                    minister”.</p>

                  <p>The health minister, Peter Dutton, said on Friday:
                    “I believe very strongly that the medical
                    evidence is clear and there is no link.”</p>

                  <p>The Breast Cancer Network of Australia raised its
                    concerns about Lanfranchi’s planned presentation
                    to the World Congress of Families.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>“As the congress has attracted significant media
                    attention recently, BCNA wishes to assure women
                    that many studies show no proven link between
                    breast cancer and abortion,” it said.</p>

                  <p>“In a review of the evidence, [Cancer Australia]
                    refers to an international analysis that examined
                    53 independent studies of over 80,000 women from 16
                    different countries. This analysis found no link
                    between breast cancer and abortion. Studies
                    completed since that time, and cited by Cancer
                    Australia, have published similar results.</p>

                  <p>“We are concerned the views being presented at
                    the congress may cause unnecessary distress to
                    women.”</p>

                  <p>Owler said Lanfranchi’s views were “completely
                    off mainstream medicine”. “The AMA represents
                    mainstream medicine; it certainly doesn’t
                    represent the views of extremists who also link the
                    oral contraceptive pill with domestic violence and
                    a whole range of other things that are completely
                    ludicrous.”</p>

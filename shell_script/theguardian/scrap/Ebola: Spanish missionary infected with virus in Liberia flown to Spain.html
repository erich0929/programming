              <p>A Spanish missionary who contracted the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/ebola" title="More from the Guardian on Ebola">Ebola</a> virus
                in Liberia is in stable condition after arriving in
                Madrid on Thursday, health officials said.</p>

              <p>Miguel Pajares, 75, arrived shortly after 8am local
                time (0700 BST) on a specially-equipped Airbus plane.
                He is the first Ebola patient of the current outbreak
                to be brought to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" title="More from the Guardian on Europe">Europe</a> for
                treatment.</p>

              <p>The hospital had been emptied of patients in
                preparation for Pajares's arrival, health union
                officials said. The 30 or so patients in the hospital
                were either sent home or to another hospital in the
                city. Pajares arrived with Juliana Bohi, a nun born in
                Equatorial Guinea and who holds Spanish nationality.
                Bohi is not thought to be infected.</p>

              <p>After a medical examination on the tarmac at the
                Torrejón air base, the pair were taken to Madrid's
                Carlos III hospital in ambulances equipped as
                biological isolation units. Police cars and motorcycles
                escorted the vehicles, and a helicopter monitored the
                situation from above.</p>

              <p>Bohi was admitted to the same hospital as a
                preventative measure, health officials said.</p>

              <p>Initial examinations showed Pajares to be in stable
                condition, according to Rafael Pérez-Santamarina, the
                director of Madrid's La Paz hospital. The city's
                regional government health chief, Francisco Javier
                Rodríguez, said Pajares was not bleeding and seemed
                not to be at an advanced stage of the illness.</p>

              to video: Spanish missionary with Ebola arrives in
              Madrid</a> </span>
              <p>Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive
                for the virus at the San José de Monrovia hospital in
                Liberia. The three were part of a larger group which
                had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as
                part of their work with the San Juan de Dios order, a
                Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals
                around the world.</p>

              <p>News of his repatriation was met with controversy in
                <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain" title="More from the Guardian on Spain">Spain</a>, and
                health professionals were concerned that Spanish
                hospitals were not properly equipped to handle the
                virus. Amyts, a trade union that represents physicians,
                called the repatriation risky. The union's president,
                Daniel Bernabéu, told the Spanish news agency Efe that
                the decision was "political rather than
                health-related".</p>

              <p>Asking if "anyone could guarantee 100% that the virus
                wouldn't escape," he said that Spain could have instead
                sent help to the priest in Liberia.</p>

              <p>He said the US, which has repatriated two of its own
                nationals to date, had 10 hospitals with the highest
                level of biosafety possible. Spain, in contrast, has
                just one adequate hospital with biosafety levels that
                were much lower.</p>

              <p>An official from the Spain's health ministry
                downplayed the potential public health risk at a news
                conference on Wednesday. The public health director
                general, Mercedes Vinuesa, assured Spaniards that the
                protocols in place for the evacuation would "guarantee
                minimum risk".</p>

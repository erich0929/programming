              <p>The Sinn Fein president, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gerryadams" title="More from the Guardian on Gerry Adams">Gerry
                Adams</a>, has warned that the political process in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland" title="More from the Guardian on Northern                 Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> faces its greatest
                challenge since the 1998 Good Friday agreement.</p>

              <p>Adams said he was not hopeful that a fresh round of
                all-party talks next month could resolve outstanding
                issues hanging over from the peace process, such as
                dealing with the legacy of the Troubles and issues over
                contentious parades and flags.</p>

              <p>The republican leader, seen as a key architect of the
                peace process, also accused both the British and Irish
                governments of being too passive by not pushing
                nationalists and unionists towards a new agreement on
                those outstanding issues.</p>

              <p>One issue capable of destabilising Northern Ireland
                – controversial marches – is set to flare up again
                this weekend.</p>

              <p>A dissident republican march to commemorate the 1971
                introduction of internment without trial is scheduled
                to pass through Belfast city centre on Sunday
                afternoon. The parade is comprised of a range of
                disparate republican groups including the 32
                Sovereignty Committee, which supports the violent
                campaign of the new <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira" title="More                 from the Guardian on IRA">IRA</a>.</p>

              <p>Ulster loyalists are mobilising to block the parade
                being routed through Royal Avenue, Belfast's main
                shopping thoroughfare. The same march last year was
                prevented from going down Royal Avenue after loyalists
                rioted in the city centre, resulting in 56 police
                officers being injured and dozens arrested.</p>

              <p>Thousands of leaflets and posters have been
                distributed across Protestant areas of Northern Ireland
                this week, calling on loyalists to block the march.</p>

              <p>On the prospects of all-party talks solving such
                issues, Adams said: "Most worryingly there is no
                evidence from Downing Street or the NIO or the Unionist
                leaderships of any likelihood of a real negotiation on
                all of these issues commencing in September."</p>

              <p>Adams accused Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa
                Villiers of adopting a "pro-unionist stance" in recent
                weeks and months.</p>

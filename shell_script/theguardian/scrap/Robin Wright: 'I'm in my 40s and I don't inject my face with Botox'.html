<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Spare a thought for Robin Wright, the ageing Hollywood
                actor who appears in a new film called <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thecongress/" title="">The Congress</a>. Once, long ago, she played
                the plucky Buttercup in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I31XZN7xeq8" title="">The Princess Bride</a> and beautiful, tragic
                Jenny in the Oscar-winning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-47cwN0w_c" title="">Forrest Gump</a>. Now her career's on the
                skids – she's the wrong side of 40. The studio loved
                her in her youth, but these days she's embarrassing.
                Any relation to the real-life Robin Wright is
                presumably coincidental.</p>

              <p>"This movie is not autobiographical in any way,"
                Wright explains by way of introduction, taking her seat
                in a conference room at the Cannes film festival.
                "Other than the fact that it uses my name and the roles
                that I did. And other than the fact that I will always
                be known as Buttercup and Jenny. Even today, after 30
                years in the business, people still come up and say
                that they loved me as Buttercup and Jenny." The more
                she protests, the less convincing she sounds.</p>

              <p>It says a lot about The Congress that it risks sowing
                such confusion, blurring the line between the actor and
                the character, inviting us to draw parallels between
                the confident, successful Wright and her gloomy,
                outmoded alter ego. Ostensibly, the film is science
                fiction – directed by the Israeli animator Ari Folman
                and spotlighting issues of intellectual property,
                internet avatars and the withering flesh. But, like the
                best SF, The Congress is actually about the here and
                now. We might not want to live in the world that it
                shows us. On some level, however, we already do.</p>

              <p>In the interest of accuracy, it should be noted that
                the real-life Wright appears to be doing just fine. In
                recent years she has acted in the likes of Moneyball
                and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtVjufzrpVQ" title="">picked up a Golden Globe</a> for her
                brilliant, steely turn as a Beltway Lady Macbeth in the
                Netflix series <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards" title="">House of Cards</a>. At the age of 48, then,
                she has already beaten the odds, fashioning a
                comfortable, rewarding career from the bonfire of
                Hollywood middle-age. Most of her contemporaries have
                not been so fortunate.</p>

              <p>"I feel very blessed," says Wright. "I'm in my 40s. I
                don't inject my face with Botox. And I've done more
                work in the past five years than I've probably done in
                my whole career. You couldn't pay me enough money to go
                back to being 20. So many tears, what a nightmare it
                was. It's much better being older." She rolls her eyes.
                "But I know what it's like for other people; I know how
                the business works. This movie is basically the macabre
                reality of what's going on now."</p>

              <p>At the start of The Congress, Wright's character is
                given an ultimatum. If she agrees to sell the rights to
                her digital image, the studio can scan her and sample
                her and put her straight back to work. That way the
                young Robin Wright is free to live on as a movie star,
                while ageing, sagging Robin Wright can shuffle off into
                moneyed obscurity. The concept, the actor points out,
                is not especially far-fetched.</p>

              <p>"Ari asked his location scouts to build a scanning
                device for the film. He wanted it to be like a CT scan,
                like an x-ray machine. But the scouts said: 'Oh no,
                there are four of those in Los Angeles already, we can
                use one of those.' " To further muddy the waters, it
                transpires that Wright had already been inside one for
                her role in Robert Zemeckis's motion-capture Beowulf
                movie. "So I don't know why Ari didn't ask me," she
                laughs. "He could have gone and got my chip. I wouldn't
                have had to be in the movie at all."</p>

              <p>Instead, The Congress proceeds to usher her straight
                through the uncanny valley: mo-cap to the left of us;
                CGI to the right. Alighting in the cartoon zone of
                Abrahama, Wright discovers that her studio avatar (by
                my count, the third incarnation of Robin Wright) has
                become the era's highest grossing digital star, taking
                her place alongside an animated Clint Eastwood and a
                grinning, toothy Tom Cruise. Along the way, the
                director juggles live action with loopy psychedelic
                animation that calls to mind the Beatles' Yellow
                Submarine period. I'm guessing the real-life Tom Cruise
                does not play the role of Tom Cruise. And yet by this
                point, the film has led us so far into the rough that
                pretty much anything is possible.</p>

              <p>Folman explains that, in conceiving the story, he
                initially experimented with the Adobe Flash cutouts he
                used on his previous film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylzO9vbEpPg" title="">the shattering 2008 documentary Waltz With
                Bashir</a>. He soon decided against them. Folman wanted
                The Congress to have a hand-tooled, old-fashioned
                quality. The best way of critiquing the state of modern
                Hollywood, he argues, is to make a film that takes us
                right back to basics.</p>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="'This movie is               basically the macabre reality of what's going on now' ...

              <p>"Modern technology has changed the whole process of
                making a&nbsp;picture," Folman says. "The role of the
                director has changed because there is no sense of
                urgency on set any more. Everything can be fixed and
                invented in post-production. These days you wouldn't
                have Francis Ford Coppola in the Philippines for 400
                days shooting Apocalypse Now. He'd do the whole thing
                in the studio and it wouldn't be the best war movie
                ever made."</p>

              <p>He gives another example. "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/blade-runner" title="">Blade Runner</a> is my favourite sci-fi film
                of all time. It's craftsmanship at its best. Everything
                was built from scratch with wood and aluminium; the
                whole of Los Angeles, built by hand. That film is 30
                years old but it will live for ever." He pulls a face.
                "But then look what happened. A few years ago, the same
                guy, the same director, Ridley Scott, made Prometheus.
                This time he had everything in terms of technology and
                look what happened, the film is forgotten already. Or
                did you see Life of Pi? I&nbsp;couldn't watch it, I saw
                the craft. It was a joke for me. It's a CGI movie."
                Hollywood's perfect digital paradise, he insists, might
                not outlive us after all.</p>

              <p>In the meantime, where does this leave the industry
                itself? Folman feels the business will split into two
                entirely distinct camps, with CGI product in the
                multiplexes and live-action drama relegated to special
                screenings in museums. If that happens, Wright knows
                which side she would rather be on. She was never keen
                on being a&nbsp;studio puppet anyway.</p>

              <p>"For actors in Hollywood, it's very straightforward,"
                she explains. "We're well-paid animals in a zoo. And if
                you agree to play the dog-and-pony show, and smile on
                the red carpet, and show up at every fucking envelope
                that's opened, then you can become a celebrity and
                become a commodity. But if you choose not to do that,
                you are seen as not bankable."</p>

              <p>Or to put it another way, Wright had her moment and
                chose to let it whistle by. Films such as The Princess
                Bride, State of Grace and Forrest Gump had made her a
                star, while her tumultuous, on-off marriage to Sean
                Penn spun her into a household name. The pressure was
                on her to play the game and book a place on the A-list.
                In a different world, a parallel universe, she might
                have been Meg Ryan, or Michelle Pfeiffer, or Sharon
                Stone: her 1990s contemporaries who seized the chance
                when they could.</p>

              <p>"Oh yeah, they wanted to make me America's
                sweetheart," she recalls. "They wanted to make me the
                next big ingenue, the studio bosses behind the curtain.
                But what happened was that I turned down a lot of
                movies that simply didn't blow my dress up. Plus I was
                too busy being a mom at the time."</p>

              <p>When a male actor turns down studio pictures, it might
                be seen as evidence of intelligence and good taste.
                When a woman does it, it is regarded as being wilful
                and awkward.</p>

              <p>Wright, it seemed, simply did not know what was good
                for her. "I&nbsp;remember there was a turning point,"
                she says. "I think it came right after Forrest Gump,
                when I turned down the cover of Vanity Fair. That was
                blasphemy. You just don't do that. And I remember,
                after that, not getting a couple of movies that I
                really wanted to do. And I was told, 'Well, you know,
                if you had done Vanity Fair it might have been
                different.' It was like I'd made this big mistake."</p>

              <p>At least she can look back on this time from a
                position of strength. Wright has weathered the
                vicissitudes of celebrity, raised two children and
                returned to the fray without missing a beat. Today,
                knocking 50, she is secure enough to stand as an emblem
                for all the other American actors who have found
                themselves shoved to the sidelines; the women who are
                viewed as too demanding, too 20th-century, too
                inconveniently long in the tooth to be put in front of
                a movie camera. The issue, she feels, is endemic.
                Youth-obsessed Hollywood shoulders a large part of the
                blame. But the general public must bear some
                responsibility too.</p>

              <p>"I'm worried that the audience is being conditioned,"
                she says. "That's my real fear. Because if they don't
                want to see wrinkles on the screen, if they actually
                fear looking at them, then it's only going to get
                worse. Those of us who don't want to shoot up and cut
                and sew, we're just not going be cast." She shrugs. "I
                don't know, it's not good. Maybe we're already past
                that point. I just pray I can keep working. I&nbsp;just
                pray I grow old gracefully." These ambitions, one
                hopes, need not be mutually exclusive.</p>

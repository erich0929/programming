                  <p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted
                    position:</strong> 5th (NB: this is not necessarily
                    Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our
                    writers’ tips)</p>

                  <p><strong>Last season’s position:</strong> 2nd</p>

                  <p><strong>Odds to win the league (via
                    Oddschecker):</strong> 12-1</p>

                  <p>The houses that lined Lothair Road behind the Main
                    Stand at Anfield are all gone now, their bricks and
                    histories bulldozed into oblivion in readiness for
                    a new 21,000-seater construction that is due to
                    rise in 2016.</p>

                  <p>Rebuilding will follow the demolition and, so
                    put-upon residents plus Liverpool City Council
                    desperately hope, regeneration will follow the
                    rebuilding. What is envisaged outside Anfield is
                    mirrored within, minus the hard hat for project
                    leader Brendan Rodgers.</p>

                  <p>Rodgers’s wrecking ball arrived via Barcelona,
                    dropped £75m and swung away with Luis Suárez
                    clinging on by his big, busy teeth. How Liverpool
                    cope with the damage is the great conundrum of
                    pre-season, answers ranging from another title
                    challenge – foreseen on this occasion –
                    consolidation in the top four or squeezed back to
                    the margins all carrying weight. And all influenced
                    by the club’s ability to sign another leading
                    striker before the transfer deadline and tighten up
                    at the back afterwards.</p>

                  <p>Beyond dispute is Liverpool’s mantle as a
                    contender and their reaction to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/11/liverpool-luis-suarez-barcelona-transfer-medical">Suárez’s
                    exit</a>. For all the revisionism that has occurred
                    subsequently – he distorted Rodgers’s preferred
                    system, we didn’t want him representing our club
                    anyway ad nauseam – the Uruguay international was
                    the world-class inspiration behind the club’s
                    strongest title challenge of the Premier League
                    era. The blow prompted a swift and considered
                    response.</p>

                  <p>There have been seven incomings at the time of
                    writing with negotiations continuing for an eighth,
                    the Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno. Loïc Rémy
                    would have made it nine but for the collapse of a
                    £8.5m transfer from Queens Park Rangers and
                    Liverpool are not finished yet, in or out. Several
                    weak spots Rodgers identified when he arrived as
                    Liverpool manager in 2012 and which undermined the
                    team’s thrilling title challenge last season have
                    been addressed, so too the squad’s depth with a
                    four-season absence from the Champions League over.</p>

                  <p>Comparisons have been made with Tottenham
                    Hotspur’s scatter-gun spending of the Gareth Bale
                    money but do not stack up. Liverpool played 43
                    competitive fixtures last season with no European
                    football on the agenda, a blow to prestige that
                    their manager accurately predicted would benefit
                    the team for one season only. Integrating several
                    new faces will naturally take time and not all will
                    settle instantly but that does not apply to three
                    recruits from Southampton. As Rodgers said, with a
                    dig at the club he rejected owing to constant
                    managerial upheaval at White Hart Lane: “It’s a
                    different club and different vision we have here.
                    At Liverpool there’s a strategy behind what we
                    are doing.”</p>

                  <p>Clearly, Liverpool anticipated Suárez’s
                    departure long before he received a four-month ban
                    for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/26/world-cup-luis-suarez-ban-biting-uruguay">biting
                    Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup</a> and began
                    issuing apologies designed for Catalonian ears.
                    Clearly, they considered the loaded question of how
                    to replace an incredible individual talent like
                    Suárez and reached the obvious conclusion; you
                    cannot.</p>

                  <p>Rodgers has rebuilt around the Suárez void,
                    increased creativity and energy in the final third

                    has gone far enough is debatable and reliant on
                    Manquillo plus Moreno adapting quickly from Spanish
                    football. There remains a need for a dominant voice
                    to emerge from goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, Martin
                    Skrtel, Mamadou Sakho and Daniel Agger, although
                    the Dane’s Anfield future is in doubt.</p>

                  <p>Rodgers has greater options, his squad appears
                    stronger and the team’s outstanding performances
                    last season should instil a confidence to withstand
                    the shock of their late collapse in the title race.
                    The manager’s philosophy and style are embedded,
                    the club has advanced ahead of schedule as a
                    result, and Liverpool enter the campaign in need of
                    fine-tuning rather than a tactical overhaul. But
                    can they immediately take that next, critical step
                    without Suárez? Clubs rarely improve by selling
                    their best player, and Liverpool’s best player
                    was the one Rodgers had developed his team around.</p>

                  <p>Suárez brought far more than 31 Premier League
                    goals to Liverpool last term. His movement and
                    instinct petrified opposition defenders, team-mates
                    prospered from his creativity and from the example
                    he set with his relentless will-to-win. Daniel
                    Sturridge may not entirely agree with that final
                    assessment, having received a few public
                    rollickings from his former strike partner, but it
                    is imperative the England international embraces
                    the position of Liverpool’s leader striker
                    following the finest season of his career and the
                    responsibility that comes with it.</p>

                  <p>“I think you’ll see Daniel go on to another
                    level again this season, with the confidence of a
                    full campaign last year and scoring the goals he
                    did,” Rodgers said. “Hopefully he can stay
                    injury free.”</p>
                  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-0591f72f-7cb4-47cf-9791-05e1f51a0d2d">

                  <p>Sturridge’s 21 goals flowed from his own
                    development as much as Suárez’s vision last term
                    and the onus is on the 24-year-old to improve as a
                    team player. He has Lambert to share that load, a
                    more rounded striker than credited for beyond
                    Southampton, a necessary alternative and a
                    significant improvement on the departed Iago Aspas.
                    Lambert can strike a dead ball for a start. Rodgers
                    has not brought the England international back to
                    his boyhood club on a misguided sentimental journey
                    yet, right now, Sturridge, Lambert and the unwanted
                    Fabio Borini represent Liverpool’s post-Suárez
                    attack. The need to strengthen is glaring, as the
                    manager has stated frequently in recent weeks.</p>

                  <p>The Sunderland target Borini and Sturridge missed
                    the final game of Liverpool’s pre-season tour of
                    the United States through injury, leaving Lambert
                    to lead the line <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/05/manchester-united-liverpool-match-report">against
                    Manchester United in Miami</a>. On the basis of
                    deals done, Liverpool have spent £90m this summer
                    and recouped £75.5m. Even if those sums rise to
                    £106m spent and £78m recouped in the coming days
                    the club, with money left over from January, the
                    new broadcasting deal and the return ticket to the
                    Champions League, have the funds for a proven
                    striker. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/07/liverpool-enquire-radamel-falcao-real-madrid-deal-close">A
                    recent inquiry for Monaco’s Radamel Falcao</a>,
                    though thwarted, indicates the pedigree being
                    targeted.</p>

                  <p>And yet Liverpool’s campaign rests on more than
                    replacing the guile and goals that have been
                    transferred to Barcelona. One of Rodgers’ first
                    aims as Liverpool manager was to improve the
                    team’s proficiency in front of goal. Job done.
                    Now he must improve the protection afforded the
                    Liverpool goal.</p>

                  <p>Manchester City scored 102 goals to Liverpool’s
                    101 in winning the league last season but conceded
                    only 37 to Liverpool’s 50. Crystal Palace, who
                    spent most of the season fighting relegation before
                    rising to 11th under Tony Pulis, conceded 48.
                    Chelsea scored 30 goals fewer than Rodgers’ side
                    but, in shipping only 27 all season, finished two
                    points behind in third. Even a modest reduction in
                    Liverpool’s goals against column last season
                    could have made a monumental difference.</p>

                  <p>Much, therefore, depends on Lovren, the discipline
                    of the three midfielders in front of him, Steven
                    Gerrard’s reaction to what he described as
                    “probably the worst three months of my life”,
                    the continued upward trajectory of Raheem Sterling
                    and the business Liverpool can or cannot conduct
                    before close of play on 1 September.</p>

                  <p>In Rodgers, Liverpool possess one of the most

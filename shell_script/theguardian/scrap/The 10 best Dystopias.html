                    Handmaid’s Tale</a></p>

                  <p><strong>Margaret Atwood, 1985</strong></p>

                  <p>Atwood disputes the theory that her 1985 novel is
                    set in a purely feminist dystopia: class comes
                    before gender as a ranking factor in Gilead, a
                    military dictatorship built on the remains of the
                    US. Still, it’s close, with women divided into
                    eight strata – “wives” at the top,
                    “unwomen” at the bottom. Somewhere between lies
                    the handmaid, one of the fertile minority required
                    to surrender control of their wombs to the
                    privileged and barren. Nearly 30 years on,
                    Atwood’s projection of the most extreme victory
                    imaginable for the anti-choice lobby retains its
                    political tang.</p>

                    Trial</a></p>

                  <p><strong>Franz Kafka, 1925</strong></p>

                  <p>“Kafkaesque” has become such a ubiquitous
                    blanket description for multiple varieties of
                    murky, irrational administration that it no longer
                    adequately implies the specifically nervous
                    qualities of Kafka’s own work. Though it was
                    published in an unfinished state in 1925, it’s
                    hard to discern which ellipses and inconsistencies
                    may be by design in this nightmare narrative of a
                    banker tried by an unknown authority for an unknown
                    crime. Perhaps it’s the government persecuting
                    Josef K that hasn’t completed its thought
                    process. Though Kafka’s legal background figures
                    heavily in this bureaucratic satire, man’s own
                    irrational morality is also on trial here.</p>

                  <p><strong>Lois Lowry, 1993</strong></p>

                  <p>You can’t move for grim prophecies and romantic
                    anti-authoritarianism in young adult fiction these
                    days. <em>The Hunger Games</em> and
                    <em>Divergent</em>, among many others, have latched
                    on to the blend of profound scepticism and socially
                    conscious idealism that bristles in 21st-century
                    teens. All of which makes Lowry’s remarkable
                    children’s novel – about a young boy elected to
                    store all human memories preceding his society’s
                    faux-utopia of Sameness – seem even more
                    forward-thinking than it did on its publication in
                    1993, when it was challenged by numerous American
                    parents’ councils and school library boards. More
                    philosophically probing than its contemporary
                    competition, and better-written too.</p>

                  <p><strong>Richard Adams, 1972</strong></p>

                  <p>The serene Berkshire meadows of Sandleford don’t
                    seem particularly dystopian, either as described in
                    Adams’s densely imagined, spiritually rich novel
                    or Martin Rosen’s exquisitely rendered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji-LqBskNyE">film
                    adaptation</a>. Underground, however, it’s a
                    different story: the lapine police state Efrafa,
                    led by demon bunny General Woundwort, was the stuff
                    of childhood nightmares (and probably a few adult
                    ones too) for any number of post-1970s babies. As
                    in Atwood’s novel, it’s the challenge of
                    reproduction that drives the conflict of class and
                    caste, though the rabbits’ survival is more
                    immediately threatened above ground too, as
                    man-driven tractors disrupt the idyll.</p>

                  <p><strong>Chris Marker, 1962</strong></p>

                  <p>Marker’s visionary film constructs as vivid and
                    philosophically searching a future as has ever been
                    projected – and does so in the space of 28
                    minutes, and mostly out of still photographs. In
                    post-third world war Paris, a prisoner is selected
                    as a guinea pig in a time-travel experiment
                    intended to repair the all-but-destroyed present;
                    shifting between past and future, he finds both the
                    key to regenerating his own society and a personal
                    existential truth that renders the former discovery
                    moot. This poetic brainteaser also provided the
                    source for Terry Gilliam’s best film, <em>12
                    Monkeys</em>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Andrew Niccol, 1997</strong></p>

                  <p>New Zealand film-maker Niccol’s debut deserves
                    special mention for the chicness of its hopeless
                    vision: its sleekly cut costumes and shimmering,
                    Oscar-nominated production design make a refreshing
                    change from the dusty aesthetic wastelands and
                    indeterminate knitwear of so many anti-utopian
                    projections. That’s marginal compensation for a
                    bleakly class-structured future dictated heavily by
                    eugenics. Cannily written as concerns about cloning
                    and genetic manipulation were hitting the headlines
                    in the late 1990s, the film’s ethically
                    multifaceted cautionary tale still hits a tender
                    spot and continues to be a handy reference point
                    for popular scientists.</p>

                  <p><strong>Simon Stålenhag, 2014</strong></p>

                  <p>Dystopic visions in modern art are dominated by
                    the kind of gaudy sci-fi landscapes suited mostly
                    to prog-rock album covers. Those are present in
                    Swedish painter Stålenhag’s work, but in rusted,
                    placated form, forced to co-exist with everyday
                    suburbia. The digitally augmented paintings centre
                    on what he calls the Riksenergi universe, a
                    middle-class slab of 1980s Scandinavia where
                    tracksuit-clad locals go about their daily
                    business, paying minimal mind to the decayed robots
                    and spacecrafts circulating passively in their
                    midst – the hangover of an abandoned government
                    science programme. Dinosaurs show up too in this
                    quiet war of multiple worlds.</p>

                  <p><strong>David Bowie, 1974</strong></p>

                  <p>No list on this subject would be complete without
                    a mention of <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, George
                    Orwell’s daddy (or Big Brother) of the genre,
                    though I’ll tip my hat to it via Bowie’s
                    dazzling sonic tribute. Bowie initially intended
                    the project as a soundtrack to a theatrical
                    adaptation of Orwell’s novel. When the author’s
                    estate denied the rights, Bowie took on the persona
                    of Halloween Jack, debauched denizen of Hunger City
                    – Manhattan after the “glitter apocalypse”.
                    Songs such as 1984 and Big Brother pay lip service
                    to Orwell; the most popular of the lot, Rebel
                    Rebel, hasn’t much to do with anything.</p>

                  <p><strong>Janelle Monáe, 2010</strong></p>

                  <p>Monáe’s sprawling R&amp;B concept album is a
                    2010 recording that looks ahead to 3005 while
                    keeping its feet planted in 1970s funk and 1990s
                    Afrofuturism. Monáe plays messianic robot Cindi
                    Mayweather, sent from the future to rescue the
                    citizens of Metropolis – the allusion to Fritz
                    Lang’s 1927 sci-fi touchstone is no accident –
                    from the oppressive, love-denying regime of The
                    Great Divide. You can debate the degree of
                    philosophical grounding behind such lyrics as:
                    “Take her back to Wondaland, she thinks she left
                    her underpant.” A reassurance that we’ll at

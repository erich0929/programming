<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>In the Australian city of Geelong, a bolshie actor
                called Scott Price is questioning his co-star's mental
                capacity. "You've got the mind of a goldfish," he
                taunts Mark Deans. "Do you?" the director joins in. "Do
                you have the mind of a goldfish?" Mark pauses for a
                long moment to consider his answer.</p>

              <p>The scene is uncomfortable to watch, even when it
                takes place on stage. In real life, Price and Deans
                have had to defend themselves from insults like this
                for years. They have disabilities, like their co-stars
                in the Back to Back theatre company. And now some of
                them are playing the Nazis who once did their best to
                exterminate the "feebleminded".</p>

              <p>The Nazi mass extermination programme for disabled
                people – known as T4 – casts a long shadow over
                Back to Back's production of Ganesh Versus the Third
                Reich. As well as Hitler himself, who is played by
                Simon Laferty, we meet a character based on Dr Josef
                Mengele (David Woods). He walks across the stage in an
                SS uniform, waxing lyrical about his passion for "the
                abnormal: birth defects, dwarfs, mongoloids,
                degenerative conditions".</p>

              <p>At one point during the play the actors break, remove
                their costumes – Ganesh's elephant head, the SS
                armband – and discuss the ethics of the play. "Do we
                have the right to perform this?" they ask.</p>

              <p>The main narrative traces the journey of Hindu deity
                Ganesh (played by Brian Tilley) travelling to Germany
                to reclaim the swastika, an ancient Sanskrit symbol,
                from the Nazis. But the actors continually drop out of
                character to challenge the director. They question the
                ethics of telling the story. None of the actors are
                Hindu, and none are Jewish. How could they even dare
                take on the Holocaust?</p>

              <p>This discomfort with the production occurred in real
                life, during rehearsals – and fragments have made
                their way into the script. It wasn't until a residency
                in Linz, Austria when Back to Back members visited the
                concentration camp Mauthausen and a nearby institution
                that had housed disabled people before the second world
                war – that the group were convinced they had a moral
                right to stage the play.</p>

              <p>"T4 was something we came to and it pushed us over the
                edge. If a company like Back to Back can't do it then
                no one can," says artistic director Bruce Gladwin. In
                Ganesh the audience are also pushed to their edge. It's
                far from politically correct theatre – there are a
                lot of sly laughs, but it's hard to escape the shadow
                over this play: the actors are the people Hitler wanted
                to exterminate.</p>

              <p>It's not a cosy production. The actors taunt the
                audience, ("You've come to see some freak porn") and
                the slightest and most gentle member of the cast plays
                its biggest monster (Simon Laherty as Hitler) –
                resulting in a visual disconnect.</p>

              <p>Not everyone comes away feeling comfortable with the
                play. An audience member in Belgium stood up during a
                Q&amp;A and said: "I don't believe these actors are
                capable of creating this. I'm not convinced they made
                this show. I know these type of people and I don't
                think they can do it."</p>

              <p>Scott Price took the microphone and told the man to
                leave. "It's not pretty but I've stood up for people,"
                he says. "In Geelong at a workshop a woman called me
                mentally challenged. I don't like that."</p>

              <p>Ganesh versus the Third Reich evolved during a
                workshop held several years before the play was first
                staged in Melbourne in 2011. "We started off Ganesh
                very open – we had no idea about content," says
                Gladwin. One of the actors developed an obsession with
                Ganesh during the workshop and was constantly drawing
                the figure. Gladwin began experimenting with amplifying
                and distorting the actors' voices and from this a
                "terrifying neo-Nazi character" was created. Unsure
                what to do with a Hindu god and a neo-Nazi, a Google
                search provided a link. "We learned that they shared a
                symbol. There were a number of websites dedicated to
                this idea that the Nazis had appropriated the swastika
                from the Hindus. We were all just fascinated with
                that."</p>

              <p>The stunning production – which has travelled to New
                York, London, Paris and Tokyo - uses backlit plastic
                curtains to evoke a night sky in India, a train journey
                through war-torn Europe, Hitler's bunker and the fall
                of the Brandenburg Gate.</p>

              <p>The New York Times critic Ben Brantley described the
                play as a "vital, senses-sharpening tonic for
                theatregoers who feel they've seen it all''. It was
                named one of the Guardian's best plays of 2012. But
                Back to Back are no flash in the pan. They are one of
                the few theatre companies operating in Australia that
                has a full-time ensemble. The company was established
                in 1987 following the deinstitutionalisation of mental
                health services in Victoria, and has toured around half
                a dozen major works. None has been more popular than
                Ganesh Versus the Third Reich.</p>

              <p>Gladwin loves watching the audience reactions –
                particularly during the more confronting parts of the
                play. "You can feel that tension when the audience
                starts sitting forwards on their seats," he says. "It's
                an interesting piece that provokes different reactions
                – where someone is in shock and someone can be
                laughing and they are sitting next to each other."</p>

              <p>• <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk/2014/ganesh" title="">Ganesh Versus the Third Reich</a> is at the
                Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 9-12 August as part of
                the Edinburgh international festival.</p>

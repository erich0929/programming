              <p>The pharmaceuticals giant Roche has been criticised in
                unprecedented terms by the government's drugs watchdog
                for refusing to significantly lower the price of a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/breast-cancer" title="More from the Guardian on Breast cancer">breast
                cancer</a> drug whose £90,000-per-patient cost is well
                over the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" title="More from the Guardian on NHS">NHS</a>'s limit.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/the-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-nice" title="More from the Guardian on The National Institute                 for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)">The National
                Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)</a>,
                says it cannot recommend the drug, Kadcyla, which
                promises extra months of life for women with advanced
                breast <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" title="More from the Guardian on Cancer">cancer</a>,
                because of Roche's inflexibility.</p>

              <p>But the company hit back, saying the pricing row
                showed that the system of cancer drug regulation was
                "broken".</p>

              <p>The system set up by the coalition in 2010 means that,
                although hospitals will not buy Kadcyla for their
                pharmacies, individual <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/doctors" title="More from the Guardian on Doctors">doctors</a>
                can apply to the separate £600m-a-year Cancer Drugs
                Fund that pays for treatments Nice regards as too
                expensive. As a result, some patients may get the drug
                because their doctors believe in it, while others will
                be denied. Critics say that is unfair and allows
                companies such as Roche to continue to charge high
                prices.</p>

              <p>Nice had warned Roche in April that it could not
                sanction the drug for NHS use because of the cost, and
                called on the Swiss-based company to think again. Nice
                says on Friday that Roche has not made any serious
                attempt to reduce the price. "Although Roche proposed a
                discount to the full list price of Kadcyla, it made
                little difference to its value for money, leaving it
                well above the top of our specially extended range of
                cost-effectiveness for cancer drugs," said Sir Andrew
                Dillon, Nice's chief executive.</p>

              <p>"We are really disappointed that Roche were not able
                to demonstrate more flexibility to help us make a
                positive recommendation. The company is well aware that
                we could not have recommended Kadcyla at the price it
                proposed."</p>

              <p>Nice decides on whether medicines are cost-effective
                for the NHS to buy. The watchdog cannot approve drugs
                for use in the NHS that cost more than £30,000 per
                patient, but is prepared to raise that ceiling to
                £50,000 for end-of-life treatments such as Kadcyla.</p>

              <p>Breast cancer charities, which normally side with the
                manufacturers of new medicines, said they regretted
                Nice's decision, but some said they understood and
                called for drug companies to lower their prices.</p>

              <p>"Kadcyla is a brilliant drug, but it's also incredibly
                expensive," said Sally Greenbrook of Breakthrough
                Breast Cancer. Nice had gone "over and above their
                usual processes to try to approve it", she said.
                "Prices set by the pharmaceutical industry for
                impressive, life-extending drugs such as Kadcyla must
                come down. It's impossible to put a price on life's
                precious moments. But it's not impossible to put a fair
                price on drugs."</p>

              <p>However, Roche's general manager, Dr Jayson Dallas,
                hit back at Nice, saying the rejection "demonstrates
                quite simply that their current system is broken, not
                fit for purpose and in need of a complete overhaul when
                it comes to advanced cancer".</p>

              <p>It was the eighth consecutive drug for advanced breast
                cancer rejected by Nice, he added, noting that Kadcyla
                was selling at the set price in the Nordic countries,
                Switzerland and Austria. But Roche is perceived by many
                to be out of line with the rest of the UK <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/pharmaceuticals-industry" title="More from the Guardian on Pharmaceuticals                 industry">pharmaceuticals industry</a>, which is
                increasingly trying to work with Nice rather than
                against it.</p>

              <p>Roche, whose then chief executive and lobbyists were
                closely involved prior to the 2010 election in the
                setting up of the Cancer Drugs Fund, is the fund's
                biggest beneficiary. Around a quarter of all
                applications to the fund are for Roche's Avastin, a
                drug rejected by Nice for both breast and bowel cancer.</p>

              <p>The situation is unsustainable, say critics. The
                Cancer Drugs Fund is overspent and effectively
                undermines the judgements made by Nice, because it will
                pay for drugs that are rejected by its expert panels on
                the grounds not just of cost but efficacy as well.</p>

              <p>Professor Richard Sullivan, director of the institute
                of cancer policy at King's College London's centre for
                global health, said the fund was neither fair nor
                useful, because it did not collect data on the outcomes
                for patients. "I have always thought it grossly unfair
                to other diseases that cancer should have a
                short-circuit around Nice," he said. "You know - you
                failed the Nice threshold but by the way, we'll still
                pay for it.</p>

              <p>"I was disappointed with the charities that failed to
                critically look at the issues around pricing and the
                failure of cancer drugs to deliver better improvements
                in outcomes. Companies are setting their prices too
                high and we're getting less return in terms of
                progression-free disease survival for increasing cost
                in a small population. The fund has really missed the
                point."Key to the establishment of the Cancer Drugs
                Fund was an inquiry, commissioned by the Labour
                government just before the 2010 election, into spending
                on drugs in the UK and other countries. It was chaired
                by cancer tsar Sir Mike Richards jointly with John
                Melville, then head of Roche Products in the UK.</p>

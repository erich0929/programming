                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>When I saw that Michelle Obama <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/06/michelle-obama-women-are-smarter-than-men/">joked
                    at the US-Africa Leaders Summit this week that
                    “women are smarter than men”</a>, I prepared
                    myself for backlash. And – what do you know? –
                    <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/michelle-obama-women-smarter-109764.html">Politico
                    wrote</a> that the First Lady had “engaged in a
                    battle of the sexes”, anti-feminist author and
                    Fox News contributor Suzanne Venker called it a <a href="https://twitter.com/SuzanneVenker/status/497376924449005568">“sexist
                    and elitist display</a>”, and the <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/michelle-obama-claims-women-are-smarter-than-men-114080700216_1.html">headline
                    at Business Standard</a> read “Michelle Obama
                    claims women are smarter than men”. As if it were
                    a serious assertion rather than a joking aside!</p>

                  <p>This isn’t the very first time Michelle Obama
                    has taken flak for, well, just about anything. Her
                    tenure in the White House has been marked by nasty
                    racist and sexist attacks (in fact, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/michelleobama.barackobama">they
                    started before President Obama took office</a>) <a href="http://wonkette.com/499899/racist-sexist-people-think-michelle-obama-is-fat-because-of-racism-sexism">on
                    her body</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/29/lay_off_michelle_obama_why_white_feminists_need_to_lean_back/">her
                    feminism</a> – <a href="http://tressiemc.com/2012/06/03/michelle-obama-beyonce-and-wonder-woman/">even
                    her love of Beyoncé</a>.</p>

                  <p>But when the First Lady made the quip – at an
                    event with former first lady Laura Bush, while
                    addressing the spouses of African leaders – it
                    wasn’t a humorless dig at men. It was a
                    light-hearted moment of girl-power on the outskirts
                    of a conference for heads of state that is
                    incredibly male-dominated.</p>

                  <p>Actually, I <em>wish</em> she’d said it with the
                    intention of mocking men – with all that
                    political, economic and social power they’ve
                    cornered by marginalizing women, I think they can
                    take a light ribbing. (I’d prefer a total
                    overthrow of the patriarchy, but I’ve always had
                    champagne tastes.)</p>

                  <p>Besides, laughter is the best medicine,
                    <em>especially</em> when it’s a guffaw redirected
                    right in the face of sexists.</p>

                  <p>Of course, women don’t <em>have</em> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/03/women-street-harassment-statistics">to
                    smile</a> if they don’t want to or hide when
                    they’re angry. But there’s little that sexists
                    fear more than being mocked by women – and that
                    makes laughing at them all the more satisfying.</p>

                  <p>(It’s interesting, too, how the same misogynists
                    who say feminists have no sense of humor are so
                    quick to pout when they’re on the receiving end
                    of it.)</p>

                  <p>There’s some of that same reasoning behind the
                    recent Twitter campaign in protest of a Turkish
                    politician’s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/30/us-turkey-women-idUSKBN0FZ0W620140730">sexist
                    comments</a>: after deputy prime minister Bulent
                    Arinc said that women “should have chastity ...
                    she should not laugh in front of everyone and not
                    be inviting in her behavior”, Turkish women
                    posted pictures of themselves laughing online. Even
                    Harry Potter star and UN goodwill ambassador for
                    women <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/emma-watson-twitter-laughing-protest">Emma
                    Watson got in on the campaign</a>. The protest
                    turned Arnic’s own words against him, and the
                    women he thought needed more control didn’t have
                    to lose their sense of joy while doing it.</p>

                  <p>In all fairness, joking about men’s (supposed)
                    inferiority doesn’t change the systemic power
                    system through which they benefit. But so long as
                    it irritates the misogynists in our midst – and
                    gives women some much-needed moments of levity –
                    I’ll keep encouraging women to laugh at
                    ridiculous men who just want them to stop already.
                    Signaling that women will do whatever they damn
                    please regardless of what men think is a winning
                    strategy.</p>

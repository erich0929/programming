              <p>You don't need a background in the food industry to
                launch a successful comestible. Ask Jim Cregan, founder
                of the Jimmy's Iced Coffee brand, which in less than
                three years has gone from being a backroom experiment
                in a Dorset cafe to a recognised, celeb-endorsed brand
                stocked by Tesco, Ocado and Whole Foods. Now, at this
                inspiring event, Jimmy explains the basics of setting
                up a food business for the novice entrepreneur.</p>

              <p>This lively evening explains, in plain English, what
                to expect when setting up a new foodie business. You'll
                learn not just how to find suppliers and stockists, but
                also how to deal with them, what to expect from them,
                and what questions you should ensure you ask them. All
                aspects of starting a business, building a brand and
                marketing your products will be explored, with the
                benefit of Jim's personal experience and vast reserves
                of enthusiasm. Come along and find out how a bit of
                elbow grease can make the impossible easy to achieve.</p>

              <h2>Tutor profile</h2>

              <p><strong>Jim Cregan</strong> went to Oz after getting
                fed up of UK winters. During his trip, he found the
                phenomenon of ready-to-drink iced coffee. After
                returning home to the UK, he realised that nobody made
                anything close to what he had on his travels and
                decided to make his own. He teamed up with his sister
                Sooz, and formed <a href="http://jimmysicedcoffee.com/"><strong>Jimmy's
                Iced Coffee</strong></a> in November 2010. Five months
                later they sold their first carton in Selfridges. Since
                their launch, they've gained listings with Tesco, BP,
                WHSmith, Waitrose, Budgens, Welcome Break and Ocado.
                Their strap line is 'Keep Your Chin Up' and is the
                foundation of what Jimmy's is all about.</p>

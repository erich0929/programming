              <h2>What are 'cookies'?</h2>

              <p>'Cookies' are small text files that are stored by the
                browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Safari) on
                your computer or mobile phone. They allow websites to
                store things like user preferences. You can think of
                cookies as providing a 'memory' for the website, so
                that it can recognise you when you come back and
                respond appropriately.</p>

              <h2>Jeff and Tracy Waters, Staines<br/>
              </h2>

              <p>"It just felt surreal, totally like a&nbsp;dream, when
                it first happened," says Jeff. "You think, is it real?"</p>

              <p>As the flood water rose up their garden early this
                year, Jeff and his wife Tracy watched in disbelief. As
                a precaution, they moved their car to higher ground.
                "Even then you're thinking, is it worth it?" Jeff says.
                When the Environment Agency told them it was going to
                get worse, they took their belongings upstairs. "That
                was the time we were a little bit scared. It kept going
                up and up&nbsp;and up."</p>

              <p>Eventually the fire brigade was pumping out the water
                and the pair&nbsp;were helping evacuate a neighbour by
                boat. "It's always been a close community," Jeff says.
                "We have annual barbecues and get-togethers. But it
                probably has made us closer." Every day until
                the&nbsp;water subsided, they waved at their neighbours
                through their upstairs&nbsp;window.</p>

              <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if it was&nbsp;linked to
                global warming somehow," Jeff says. "But everyone's
                blaming it on the Thames silting up, on it not being
                dredged, on the drains. Years ago I&nbsp;remember
                seeing a big council lorry come round, put a big pipe
                down the drain and suck all the muck out. You don't see
                that any more."</p>

              <p>Now that summer is here and the buildings are dry, the
                flood seems almost unimaginable. "You wouldn't believe
                it's the same place," Jeff&nbsp;says. "You'd think
                nothing ever&nbsp;happened."</p>

              <p>"I've got it in red pen in my diary here," says Tricia
                Barnes, 67, a&nbsp;boutique worker who lives in Old
                Windsor with her younger sister, Julie. "It comes over
                the patio on the fifth of January. And then it comes up
                through the drains and through the garage, and meets
                there. On 6&nbsp;January it comes into the house. It
                just kept coming and coming. It came into the hall the
                next day and got deeper and deeper, until on the 10th
                we evacuated to my godmother's in Dorney. The dog had
                to swim out. And that was just the first flood."</p>

              <p>Tricia and Julie have lived here, right on the river,
                for 26 years. It was a newly built town house when they
                bought it, standing beside five others down a long
                shared driveway. "We were the first people to live
                here, and the river and the view were part of the
                charm."</p>

              <p>They recall a huge flood in 2003, and a couple of
                inches of water in 2012, but this year two floods in
                quick succession brought 28 inches of water to their
                downstairs room. Between them they lugged precious
                possessions upstairs and placed furniture on stacks of
                bricks. "You're really on your tod, you're marooned,"
                Tricia says. "You can't get friends calling round to
                help unless they've got chest-high waders.</p>

              <p>"But it's the aftermath as well," she adds. "It's what
                it leaves behind. You get so much mud – four or five
                inches. And shovelling mud is not an easy job. But we
                didn't cry, did we, Julie? We're quite stoic like
                that."</p>

              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="Richard Large " data-pin-description="Richard Large.

              <p>Richard Large and his wife had decamped to their son's
                house in Reading by the time the floods reached
                Moorland. But Richard, 67, a&nbsp;gunsmith and CCTV
                engineer, was able to watch the progress of the water
                via the closed-circuit cameras installed around the
                house.</p>

              <p>He followed it as it rose up his driveway and on
                towards his front door. "And I kept on watching, pretty
                much 24 hours a day, until the freezer in the garage
                succumbed to the water – that put the mains off and I
                lost communication," he recalls. "I felt completely
                helpless. I&nbsp;was in a dreadful state, I&nbsp;was
                having trouble speaking."</p>

              <p>Like many locals, Richard believes that the village
                was flooded to protect the town of Bridgwater, and that
                there wasn't enough dredging. "At the last minute they
                opened the reservoir, because they thought it was going
                to breach. They opened the sluice gates and emptied the
                whole lot on top of us." And then, he says, there was
                40 cubic metres of water a&nbsp;second pouring on to
                this land. "I&nbsp;don't know if you can picture that?"
                We are sitting on his patio and he waves his arm out
                towards the wide lawn and the trees beyond. "Take an
                area the size of this garden, a metre deep, every
                second.</p>

              <p>"I miss the garden," he says. "I&nbsp;miss being able
                to walk along the riverbank. And my wife feeling safe."
                The ordeal and upheaval has affected her badly. "She's
                disabled. She's in hospital at the moment. It's really
                knocked her back. The whole lot together's just been
                too much for her." And it has, he admits, knocked him
                back, too. "I thought I was fireproof, nothing could
                get to me," he says. "Because I'd always made plans for
                what I would do. But this time, I couldn't do
                anything."</p>

              <p>By the time the police helicopter hovered over their
                house urging them to evacuate, it was already too late.
                Dave and Sue Donaldson, their daughter Heather, 12, and
                son Luke, 18, who is severely disabled, were unable to
                leave their property not far from Moorland. It was the
                emergency services who finally helped Sue and the
                children get out, relocating them to a bungalow not far
                away.</p>

              <p>Dave stayed on. For a week he lived in the house, then
                moved to the large shed in the garden. "I stayed for
                the animals," he explains. Local farmers took in the
                ponies, the goat, the sheep and chickens. "But the pigs
                were too hard to move. Then there's the dogs. And I've
                got three cats."</p>

              <p>It has made for a strange few months. Outside, a trail
                of devastation: duckweed, detritus, 85mph winds,
                police, roadblocks. "It looked like something out of a
                weird sci-fi movie," Dave says. Inside, the shed
                acquiring the air of solitary male existence: a TV,
                dartboard, sofa; a Confederate flag and a poster of
                Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. His two dogs sprawl on
                the sofa; a chicken bobs in to say hello. "In some ways
                it's been quite nice-ish. But obviously when you've got
                family, you want to be back together."</p>

              <p>Sue and the children will return next week. The house
                renovations are now well under way, project-managed by
                Dave. "It's been pretty straightforward, really. Part
                of it's been rewired, and the walls were stripped off
                three foot and rerendered and plastered." Today in the
                hallway that once ran two feet deep with water,
                decorators are painting the walls a shade of pale blue.
                "You don't need an awful lot of water to ruin a house,"
                Dave says.</p>

              <p>The other improvement has been the new sense of
                community. "We used to ignore each other. We were like
                passing ships, a lot of us. But of course it's brought
                us all together."</p>

              <p>One night, after the water had subsided, they held a
                disco at the village hall with an underwater theme.
                Dave, a former sculptor, made a booth for the DJ in the
                shape of a submarine. "We had a machine pumping smoke
                through the portholes." He smiles. "Everyone got
                wrecked. There's photos of people dancing on it later
                in the night."</p>

              <p>Shirley's father Walter built this house in 1955. "Me
                and my brother-in-law," Walter recalls. "He did the
                building, I did the labouring. Every brick I handled."</p>

              <p>The house is set on the flat plains of the Somerset
                Levels and the banks of the river Parrett. Look out
                through the window of the utility room and you will see
                the broad fields that belonged to Walter's father, a
                farmer.</p>

              <p>The floods this year were the worst they'd seen.
                Shirley – chest-deep in water, her father evacuated
                – was devastated by the damage to her home and
                distraught at the decades of family photographs
                floating around her living room.</p>

              <p>Since then, life has been reduced to a temporary home
                in Bridgwater and a caravan in the front garden, from
                which Shirley oversees the renovations. The walls she
                once decorated have now been stripped and replastered,
                and the rooms buzz with electricians, here to rewire
                the entire house. But you can still smell the damp in
                the air, still see the white line of the watermark that
                runs across the front door.</p>

              <p>It is Shirley who has muddled through the insurance
                claims and fought for the work to begin on their home,
                and now she is exhausted. "Six months this has been
                going on," she says. "There is no time any more –
                time doesn't mean anything. Every day you're just
                rolling along. You're fighting all the time, there's
                paperwork all the time, and you get confused. You start
                to wonder, what's this form for?"</p>

              <p>She has been most upset about the loss of her hobby
                farm up the road. Though she could not reach it during
                the floods, she knew the damage would be bad. "I could
                see it," she says, "across the water."</p>

              <p>She is unsure whether she will ever be able to rebuild
                it: her calves and her chickens have been safely
                rehomed, but the ruined stables will not be covered by
                her insurance. "I&nbsp;can't get any help. I don't fall
                into any category at all." She looks bereft. "It was a
                beautiful little paradise," she says</p>

              <p>"I left at three o'clock to collect the children,"
                remembers Amante Witherick, 43, who runs a balloons and
                chair-cover company. "No water was in the house then.
                But my partner Stuart rang me at quarter to four and
                said three rooms were completely flooded. Forty-five
                minutes, and we were two inches under water."</p>

              <p>A short while later, Amante called her partner again.
                "And he said, 'I'm terribly sorry but I've had to take
                a&nbsp;sledgehammer to one of the floors.' He could
                feel the pressure building and the floor shaking, and
                so he hammered a hole in the hallway, and a big
                fountain of water came up."</p>

              <p>Amante, a former diver, speaks about water with a
                certain reverence; she talks of watching the floods
                coming across the fields, of blocking the drains and
                wondering, where is the water going to go? It&nbsp;will
                happen again, she believes. "It's global warming, it's
                what we're doing to our environment. You can't stop the
                rain.</p>

              <p>"I take water hugely seriously," she says. "I've been
                in lots of situations where I've had to rescue people,
                and I've had very dear friends die in diving
                accidents." Once she spent two days at sea on a life
                raft without food when the boat she was living on blew
                up. "When you've been through something like that,
                honestly this is nothing. We saved our kids and our
                cat. That's the important bit – not your stuff."</p>

              <p>Still, after eight years in a house they renovated
                themselves, there are some things that cannot easily be
                replaced: the kitchen they loved, the summerhouse, and
                all of the memories that can gather at certain points
                in a home.</p>

              <p>"I remember being pregnant and painting the pillar in
                the hallway, and how I had paint all over my belly,"
                Amante says. "And that will be gone now – the pillar
                has to be replaced and repainted. I'll never look at it
                again and laugh about those little memories." She
                brightens. "But it's not the important stuff."</p>

              <p>"It was opening the main gates of the building to see
                this tangled mass of timber, machinery and debris
                floating," says Neil Craddock, 65, describing the
                lowest point in his engineered wood flooring company
                being flooded. "To stare into that, you can't actually
                think that you could ever sort it out. But you can.
                Everything's doable. You've just got to be determined."</p>

              <p>Craddock, a trained engineer who moved into wood
                flooring two decades ago, built his factory here 11
                years ago. Flooded in 2012, the building could not be
                insured. "So all of the damage I've had to pay for out
                of our funds," he says. They lost machinery, equipment
                and timber stock, as well as sustaining damage to the
                building itself. And, for the 20 weeks that the factory
                was out of operation he had the cost of keeping his six
                members of staff in employment. "I don't want to put a
                figure on it," he says. "But it was an awful lot of
                money."</p>

              <p>Today he walks around the factory, showing the mark on
                the wall where the water reached – around 8ft high,
                and recalling the extent of the damage. "You could've
                cried," he says. "That's when you have to dig deep. But
                you find there's a resistance within you. We all just
                got stuck in and started physically pulling timber out
                of the building. There's no point just looking at it."</p>

              <p>While other local firms have buckled under the damage
                wrought by the floods, Craddock insists he and his
                staff were determined to get back to work, and now
                business is thriving.</p>

              <p>"There was never any question that we would give up,"
                he says. "And I think ultimately now we are back in
                business it's a better place – people are more
                positive. We've survived, we've come out the other end
                and rebuilt ourselves."</p>

              <h2>Peter and Marion Hilling, Burrow Bridge,
                Somerset<br/>
              </h2>
              <span class="inline wide"> <img alt="Peter Hilling" data-pin-description="Peter Hilling. Photograph: Gideon               Mendel" height="461" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/8/6/1407328369515/Peter-Hilling-005.jpg" width="460"/> <span class="caption" style="width:               460px;"> Peter Hilling.

              </span>
              <p>Over the course of a couple of weeks the flood water
                gradually reduced Marion Hilling's life to a small
                island. "You could see every day it was coming nearer,"
                says the retired teaching assistant, 64. "I had marker
                sticks in the lawn and every day I was moving them
                nearer and nearer the house."</p>

              <p>She moved her car to higher ground, dragged her
                furniture upstairs, took two of her three cats to a
                cattery, and settled down to life in her
                kitchen."Because the rest of the house was so empty,"
                she explains, "because all the furniture was gone."</p>

              <p>When the septic tank went under water, she was left
                with no plumbing. "So I was washing down in a bowl of
                water and then throwing it across the lawn. I was doing
                that for several weeks. I'm sure was in a really bad
                mental state – I kept bursting into tears. And I lost
                an awful lot of weight, because when you feel like that
                you're so stressed that your throat constricts and you
                can't eat. When I next had my hair cut my hairdresser
                said I'd actually got a bald patch. She said that's
                stress."</p>

              <p>On the morning of 5 February the water had reached 3ft
                from the front door, and Hilling could see it ebbing
                into the yard at the side of the house. "That morning,"
                she remembers, "I sat on the top of the stairs and
                thought, I'm going to have to go soon, this is not
                good."</p>

              <p>A friend appeared on her doorstep and tried to
                convince her to leave. "And I said, 'Oh no, I'm sure
                the water will go down, it won't get as far as the
                house.' But I think she alerted the police in the
                village and they came and got me. She came as well,
                which was really lovely, and I cried on her shoulder.
                They took me off in a 4x4 with a cat basket and took me
                round to a holiday let."</p>

              <p>For many years, Marion, her husband Peter and their
                two sons lived in Hong Kong (where Peter was working
                when the floods hit). "We lived 12 floors up in a tower
                block," she recalls. "So when we moved here 18 years
                ago, this was like paradise; in all the years of
                high-rise living I just wanted to be somewhere I could
                grow vegetables."</p>

              <p>It is a handsome house, built in 1897, with five
                bedrooms, outbuildings and four acres of land. The
                garden itself covers about an acre and is where Hilling
                likes to spend the bulk of her time. "I grow runner
                beans, spinach, sea kale, beetroot, peas, broad beans,
                asparagus," she says. But the flood took around a third
                of her plants. "Big established shrubs," she says.
                "Plants as tall as this room. Eighteen-year-old lilac
                bushes."</p>

              <p>But the floods have changed how she feels about this
                paradise, and if she could she would up sticks and move
                far away. "Yes. Oh yes. But my husband wouldn't," she
                says, looking small and weary in her kitchen chair. "I
                don't feel so sentimentally attached to it now. It's
                just a house."</p>

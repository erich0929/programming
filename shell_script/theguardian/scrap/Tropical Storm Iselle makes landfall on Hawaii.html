                  <p>Associated Press= HONOLULU (AP) â The first
                    storm in a one-two punch heading for Hawaii
                    clamored ashore overnight Friday as a weakened
                    tropical storm, while a second system close behind
                    it strengthened and was on track to pass north of
                    the islands.</p>

                  <p>Tropical Storm Iselle's eye crossed onto the Big
                    Island about 5 miles east of Pahala with winds at
                    60 mph at 2:30 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time. Iselle is
                    the first tropical storm to hit the state in 22
                    years. Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm, is some
                    900 miles behind in the Pacific, packing maximum
                    sustained winds of about 120 mph, but was forecast
                    to weaken and skirt north of all the Hawaiian
                    islands starting sometime Sunday morning.</p>

                  <p>No deaths or major injuries were reported from
                    Iselle. So far the extent of damage across the Big
                    Island, one of the least populated in the state,
                    has been limited to downed trees and some roof
                    damage, Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesman John
                    Drummond said.</p>

                  <p>About 21,000 homes remained without power, he
                    said.</p>

                  <p>The storm is expected to inundate Hawaii with 5 to
                    8 inches of rain, and up to a foot in some spots.</p>

                  <p>Drummond said the main part of the storm came
                    ashore in a rural and sparsely populated region and
                    didn't sweep across the entire island.</p>

                  <p>"We're waiting for the storm to move out of the
                    area," he said. "We're still getting wind from the
                    outer portions."</p>

                  <p>Heavy rains and wind from the storm's outer bands
                    were also hitting Maui and Oahu on Friday as Iselle
                    moved to the west but south of the other islands.</p>

                  <p>The Big Island remained under a flash flood
                    warning, with the southern region getting 4 inches
                    of rain per hour.</p>

                  <p>"From the sense we're getting from the weather
                    service, I don't think it's going to get much worse
                    than this," Drummond said.</p>

                  <p>Iselle was downgraded to a tropical storm about 50
                    miles from shore at 11 p.m. HST Thursday, and
                    within hours its winds had slowed to 60 mph, well
                    below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.</p>

                  <p>Experts said wind shear chopping at the system and
                    the Big Island's mountainous terrain helped weaken
                    the storm.</p>

                  <p>"As wind blows into the terrain, the terrain kind
                    of redirects the wind," said Chris Brenchley,
                    meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
                    Honolulu.</p>

                  <p>Video shot by Big Island residents showed winds
                    blowing through palm trees, white foamy waves
                    chopping high onto shoreline shrubs and rocks
                    â even a surfer riding rolling waves with an
                    overcast sky on the Big Island's eastern shore.</p>

                  <p>"I can't say I'm too worried," said Andrew
                    Fujimura, 29, of Puna. "Worst-case scenario, the
                    power may go out a day or two. But we're prepared
                    for that kind of stuff out here."</p>

                  <p>Hundreds of people flowed into emergency shelters
                    set up at high schools on the Big Island, one of
                    which lost power for a time.</p>

                  <p>On Maui, power to a water treatment plant went
                    out, prompting county officials to ask Kula
                    residents in the middle of the island to conserve
                    water.</p>

                  <p>People prepared for the storm by making
                    last-minute trips to the store and boarding up
                    windows at their homes.</p>

                  <p>Hawaii has been directly hit by hurricanes only
                    three times since 1950. The last time Hawaii was
                    hit with a hurricane or tropical storm was in 1992,
                    when Hurricane Iniki killed six people and
                    destroyed more than 1,400 homes in Kauai.</p>

                  <p>Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said the state was
                    prepared for the back-to-back storms, noting the
                    National Guard is at the ready and state and local
                    governments were closing offices, schools and
                    transit services across Hawaii.</p>

                  <p>"What we're asking the people to do now is pay
                    attention, stay focused and listen to the
                    directions," he said.</p>

                  <p>Abercrombie said President Barack Obama had been
                    briefed on Iselle, while Saturday's primary
                    elections, including congressional and
                    gubernatorial races, will go forward as planned.</p>

                  <p>As residents prepared for the storms, a
                    4.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Big Island on
                    Thursday but didn't cause major damage or injuries.

                  <p>Travelers faced disrupted plans when at least 50
                    flights were canceled by several airlines,
                    including Hawaiian Airlines, Delta, United, Air
                    China and WestJet, the Hawaii Tourism Authority
                    said. Some airlines waived reservation change fees
                    and fare differences for passengers who needed to
                    alter their plans Thursday and Friday.</p>

                  <p>Other attractions also announced plans to stay
                    closed for all or part of Friday, including the
                    Royal Hawaiian Center mall in Waikiki and the
                    Polynesian Cultural Center near Oahu's north shore.

                  <p>After high winds hit Maui, California couple Rudy
                    Cruz and Ashley Dochnahl left the island earlier
                    than planned, getting to Oahu but failing to secure
                    a flight back home. "We were trying to beat it, but
                    we now will have to ride it out," Cruz said.</p>

                  <p>The storms are rare in Hawaii but not unexpected
                    in El Nino years, a change in ocean temperature
                    that affects weather around the world.</p>

                  <p>Ahead of this year's hurricane season, weather
                    officials warned the wide swath of the Pacific
                    Ocean that includes Hawaii could see four to seven
                    tropical storms this year.</p>

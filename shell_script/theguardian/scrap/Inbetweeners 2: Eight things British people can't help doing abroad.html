              <p><strong>Sweating</strong></p>

              <p>Britain once had a global reputation for excellence in
                many things: engineering, football, cross-dressing,
                empire building, genocide. One by one, we've lost these
                crowns to new upstarts on the block like Costa Rica,
                Thailand and Vladimir Putin. Sadly, there are few
                things that we Britons can say we truly excel at these
                days. Except we produce sweat like no other nation. Put
                us in a slightly-above-room-temperature environment and
                it literally pours out of us. Buckets of the stuff. The
                second we step off the plane and feel the heat rising
                off the tarmac, we become sentient water features,
                leaving saline puddles in our wake as we huff and puff
                to the nearest air-conditioned building. We rule at
                sweating.</p>

              <p><strong>Hunting down amusing signs in badly written
                English</strong></p>

              <p>God help you if you've attempted to pass useful
                information on to your English-speaking patrons by
                writing a sign and then committed a grammatical faux
                pas within it. Your crime will be instantly
                Instagrammed and compiled into a Reddit meme list
                before you can say "curse you Google translate". You
                well-meaning idiots.</p>

              <p><strong>Swilling booze</strong></p>

              <p>Watching Britons drink booze abroad can't be
                dissimilar to witnessing the last few hours before
                prohibition was introduced to Chicago in 1920. Or the
                fall of Rome. We drink alcohol like someone is going to
                take it away from us. Maybe it's ying to the yang of
                sweating (see above, Sweating); what came first, the
                perspiration or the problem drinking? When Iain Morris
                and I went on a research trip to Malia for the first
                Inbetweeners movie we'd forgotten about this universal
                law for Brits abroad. We arrived on the main strip of
                bars at sunset, comfortably the oldest and sweatiest
                lifeforms there. After a few hours of being eyed with
                suspicion by the hordes of young Brits we let it slip
                that we wrote The Inbetweeners. Tragic, I know, but
                after that we were at least allowed to get on with the
                drinking without making anyone else feel too
                uncomfortable.</p>

              <p><strong>Live-action tweeting</strong></p>

              <p>If any of you follow @IainKevanMorris on Twitter, the
                aforementioned evening made for a wonderful feed. It
                started:</p>

              <p>10.03pm: I'm here it's a bit weird, bit edgy, don't
                think I like it.</p>

              <p>11.01pm: It's only young people having fun. I don't
                know why the press give it such a bad rep.</p>

              <p>11.42pm: We're in the banana club. big up dj vaz</p>

              <p>12.17am: I'm having the best night of my life, don't
                listen to anyone its incredible.</p>

              <p>01.55 am: Ooh ahh Malia. Oggy oggy oggy.</p>

              <p>â€¦And eight hours later: I'm in a Greek hospital I've
                broken my wrist quite severely.</p>

              <p><strong>Displays of breathtaking superiority</strong></p>

              <p>Most Brits heading out into the world will broadly
                assume anywhere that lies longitudinally south of
                Calais is part of the third world. Usually this
                attitude manifests itself in the question: "Is it safe
                to drink the tap water?" I know it's hard to believe
                but even in Spain, the 14th largest economy in the
                world, they have adequate water sanitation. I'm not
                vouching for Bulgaria, though.</p>

              <p><strong>Speaking the lingo</strong></p>

              <p>Over the years we've become slightly more adventurous
                with foreign languages. These days, rather than simply
                pointing at stuff and speaking loudly in English we've
                developed a new form of multilingualism, which involves
                still speaking in English but with a subtle hint of a
                local accent. Maybe with the odd word of French or
                Spanish thrown in. We call this new tongue Joey
                Bartonese.</p>

              <p><strong>Experimenting with food</strong></p>

              <p>August 1989. Playa de Las Americas, Tenerife. The date
                is seared in my brain as the day I ate my first fresh
                tomato. It was mistakenly placed in, or rather not
                removed by me, from a sandwich I'd ordered while drunk
                (see above, Swilling booze). I was 18 years old and
                outraged. It's this sense of culinary adventure that
                foreign travel inspires in us all.</p>

              <p><strong>Following the rules</strong></p>

              <p>Let's be honest, not just following the rules but
                constant upkeep of the rules. Who else will ensure that
                nobody flouts the conventions of queuing. Or sort out
                territorial transgressions in overhead baggage
                compartments? Without us there wouldn't be a global
                tourism industry, there'd be chaos. And the Germans
                would be up at dawn reserving the best seats to watch
                the madness from.</p>

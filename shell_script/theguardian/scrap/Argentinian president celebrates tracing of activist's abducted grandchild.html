              <p>The leader of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights" title="More from the Guardian on Human rights">human
                rights</a> organisation Grandmothers of the Plaza de
                Mayo, who found her grandson 36 years after his
                abduction by the Argentinian military junta, has been
                congratulated by the country's president, Cristina
                Fernández de Kirchner.</p>

              <p>"She asked me if it was true, I said yes, and we both
                cried, in the middle of that joyful moment," said
                Estela Carlotto.</p>

              <p>"Today <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina" title="More from the Guardian on                 Argentina">Argentina</a> is a more just country than
                yesterday," Fernández, who has been a strong supporter
                of the activists, tweeted later.</p>

              <p>Carlotto said she was waiting for the right moment to
                see her grandson, the 114th missing child to be found
                by the Grandmothers group, which was established to
                find the missing children of political opponents
                murdered by Argentina's military dictatorship in the
                1970s.</p>

              <p>"I haven't spoken on the phone to him because I don't
                want to force the situation," Carlotto added. "He's
                spoken with my daughter Claudia and says he will be
                coming soon to meet&nbsp;us. Yesterday we took a
                picture of ourselves and wanted to send it to him, but
                we didn't want to scare him. I want to meet him, I want
                to see if he is like I imagined him. But it is a slow
                process that won't be easy for him."</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Carlotto told a press conference on Tuesday she had
                discovered her grandson, missing for 36 years, thanks
                to DNA testing. "I didn't want to die without hugging
                him," she said.</p>

              <p>Between 1976 and 1983, about 500 newborns were taken
                from arrested young opponents of the regime and handed
                over to military families to be raised according to the
                "western and Christian values" that the regime claimed
                to defend. Others were given up for adoption to
                unsuspecting couples. The real parents were murdered.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>Carlotto's daughter had named her son Guido before she
                was murdered by the military, according to surviving
                witnesses at the La Cacha death camp where she was
                held. Until now, he has lived under the name Ignacio
                Hurban as the son of Clemente and Juana María Hurban,
                two retired farm workers in Olavarría, a city in the
                province of Buenos Aires. It is not yet known how the
                couple came to adopt him.</p>

              <p>"We know they are farm people," said Carlotto. "So
                they must have raised him on the farm, maybe they had
                no idea."</p>

              <p>Ignacio Hurban has raised a family of his own and
                teaches music in Olavarría. He has had a distinguished
                career as a fusion musician, mixing classical, jazz and
                Argentinian folklore musical styles in his work. He has
                worked as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeKiA44C0A" title="">session musician</a> for some of Argentina's
                folk music stars, and once with British avant garde
                saxophonist George Haslam.</p>

              <p>On 24 March this year, Hurban posted a song entitled
                Para la Memoria (To Memory), referring to Argentina's
                years of dictatorship, on his Bandcamp page,
                illustrated with an artistic interpretation of the
                handkerchief worn by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.
                "Neither the doors nor the wounds of years gone by have
                closed," <a href="http://ignacio-hurban.bandcamp.com" title="">say the lyrics.</a></p>

              <p>In an article he wrote for the daily El Popular this
                year, talking about his musical work, Hurban pretended
                he was his dog typing at his computer. "I've heard him
                say he composes, which I think is something like making
                a hole where there wasn't anything to start with," he
                wrote about himself.</p>

              <p>He was identified after he presented himself
                voluntarily at the DNA bank the Grandmothers had set up
                with the blood samples of all the group's&nbsp;members.</p>

              <p>He was born on 26 June 1978 at the military hospital
                in Buenos Aires. His mother, Laura Carlotto, was 23
                years old and two months pregnant when she was
                kidnapped by the military in November 1977 and taken to
                La Cacha in the city of La Plata in Buenos Aires
                province.</p>

              <p>The news of his discovery was also joyfully received
                by his 91-year-old paternal grandmother, Hortensia
                Montoya. "I can't wait to meet him, to have him near,
                to hug him, to know that he is my grandchild."</p>

              <p>According to some reports, her son Oscar Montoya,
                Hurban's biological father, was tortured and murdered
                in front of Laura Carlotto at the La Cacha death camp.
                Oscar Montoya was also a musician, and had a group
                called Nosotros y Ustedes (We and You) in his hometown
                of Cañadón Sec in the southern province of Santa
                Cruz, where a music theatre was named after him a few
                years ago.</p>

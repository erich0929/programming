                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>I couldn’t get my four-year-old to eat a raw
                    tomato if I tried. Funny then that some of her
                    favourite cooked meals are those that include
                    tomato, the fresh or tinned variety. Tomatoes
                    cooked simply with garlic and olive oil is surely
                    one of gastronomy’s finest triumvirates for
                    adults and children alike.</p>

                  <p>I had some stale white bread – too old for
                    sandwiches and too good to for the birds – and
                    cooking with bread is a task I especially like.
                    Savoury bread puddings in the winter, fattoush
                    salads in summer and this Tuscan-inspired soup are
                    among three of my best bread-based family dishes.</p>

                  <p>With the summer holidays in full swing, the
                    children sat outside and ate this soup for lunch.
                    Served warm, not piping hot, the bread is softened
                    in the tomato and garlic juices with plenty of
                    basil and a slick of olive oil. A tomato sandwich
                    so to speak except, on the soupy side, and one that
                    a tomato-hating four-year-old happily ate.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>(serves 4)</em></strong><br/>
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>6 large very ripe tomatoes</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>200g stale white bread</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely
                    sliced</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Large bunch of basil (leaves picked and
                    roughly chopped and totalling 20g)</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>600ml cold water</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>4 tablespoons of olive oil</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>½ tsp of red wine vinegar</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Pinch of sugar</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></p>

                  <p>With a sharp knife, make a slit in the side of
                    each tomato ½cm into the skin.</p>

                  <p>Drop the tomatoes into boiling water and simmer in
                    a high-sided saucepan, submerging them completely
                    for 15 seconds.</p>

                  <p>Remove the tomatoes with a slotted spoon and run
                    under cold water. The skins should now easily slip
                    off.</p>

                  <p>Peel and chop the middle out of each tomato and
                    discard. Roughly chop the flesh into 1cm dice.</p>

                  <p>Drain the water from the pan and add half the
                    olive oil, then the garlic and gently sweat over a
                    low heat for three to five minutes until soft but
                    not brown.</p>

                  <p>Add the tomato flesh with a pinch of sugar and
                    cook over a gentle heat for 10 minutes until
                    softened and smelling sweet.</p>

                  <p>Roughly tear the stale bread into 2½cm pieces and
                    add to the tomatoes. Add the cold water, bring to
                    the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about five
                    minutes, until the bread breaks down and absorbs
                    the water.</p>

                  <p>Take the soup off the heat, add the basil,
                    vinegar, salt and pepper, and remaining olive oil.</p>

                  <p>Rest for five minutes or so for the flavours to
                    meld, and serve warm, not piping hot.</p>

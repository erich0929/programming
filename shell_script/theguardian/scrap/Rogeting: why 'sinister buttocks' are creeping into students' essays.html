              plagiarising their work, unscrupulous students are using
              a thesaurus app to ring the changes on essays
              copy-and-pasted from the internet. The results are often
              hilariously inept</div>

              <p><strong>Name: </strong>Rogeting.</p>

              <p><strong>Age:</strong> A modern twist on an age-old
                practice.</p>

              <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Baffling, perplexing,
                mystifying, strange, confusing, puzzling.</p>

              <p><strong>Explain, please. </strong>You mean clarify?
                Elucidate? Illuminate? Expound? Explicate?</p>

              <p><strong>Any one of those, yes. </strong>OK. Very well.
                As you wish. It is the practice of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/students" title="More from the Guardian on Students">students</a>
                replacing words and phrases in essays they have copied
                from the internet with supposedly synonymous
                alternatives in order to disguise their plagiarism.</p>

              <p><strong>Cunning! Crafty! Sly! Wily! Sneaky! Devious!
                Scheming! Shrewd! </strong>Or, frequently, not.</p>

              <p><strong>How so? </strong>Chris Sadler, the lecturer
                who coined the neologism did so after coming across a
                number of phrases in his business students' work that
                did not make sense.</p>

              <p><strong>Such as?</strong> <strong>For instance? Like?
                </strong>Like "to tarry fore of the conflict".</p>

              <p><strong>Eh? Pardon? Huh? What? </strong>A tin-eared
                translation of "to stay ahead of the competition". Now
                try "Herculean personalised liturgies".</p>

              <p><strong>Err … a very moving individual rite?
                </strong>No, it's a ham-fisted rendering of "more
                powerful personalised services".</p>

              <p><strong>These students are idiots. Morons. Dunces.
                Block/bone/pinheads. Derbrains. 'Nanas. </strong>"Even
                if the sentence had made sense it seemed out of place
                in [a paper on] business information systems and I was
                motivated to seek out the source," Sadler said.</p>

              <p><strong>Is he actually Rogeting as he speaks?
                </strong>No – all business information systems
                lecturers sound a bit like that.</p>

              <p><strong>Well, set a bandit, crook, pilferer, plunderer
                to catch a larcener, criminal, defalcator, cheat I
                suppose. </strong>He has entered his favourite Rogetism
                in the annual competition held by the Times <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education" title="More from the Guardian on Higher                 education">Higher Education</a> Supplement to find the
                most grievous, glaring, atrocious, egregious exam
                mistakes.</p>

              <p><strong>Which is? </strong>"Sinister buttocks".</p>

              <p><strong>What was that in its original incarnation? Let
                me guess … scary bum from "frightening tramp"? No,
                I've got nothing. </strong>It's a freeform restyling of
                the simple phrase "left behind."</p>

              <p><strong>Idiots. Morons. Dunces. Et cetera. And so on.
                And so forth. </strong>"[There's] no attempt to
                understand either the source or target text," says
                Sadler.</p>

              <p><strong>I couldn't have put it better myself, Mr
                Sadler. </strong>Mr Sadler, Burdener, Inflicter,
                Encumberer, Loader or possibly Farrier thanks you.</p>

              <p><strong>Do say:</strong> "I've been imitated so well
                I've heard people copy my mistakes." (Jimi Hendrix)</p>

              <p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Thanks, Jimi, that sounds
                like a plan."</p>

          <p>"Everyone is expecting me to fail," <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10987122/Camilla-Cleese-People-are-looking-to-hate-me.html" title="">Camilla Cleese said </a>ahead of her Edinburgh
            fringe debut. A bit strong, but there's no denying that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/19/john-cleese-comedian-interview" title="">dad John</a> casts a long shadow. Tonight,
            performing 20 minutes as part of a three-hander US <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy" title="More from the Guardian on Comedy">comedy</a> bill,
            she confounds the doubters. There's barely time to make a
            significant mark, but she showcases a playfully
            black-hearted persona and exudes a confidence that suggests
            she won't readily be eclipsed by&nbsp;anyone – not even
            daddy.</p>

          <p>There are gags about her famous father, of course – but
            she has the self-possession to make us wait for them. First
            she jokes about her height – she's 6ft-plus – and the
            sins committed by small men, including (when his blades are
            removed) Oscar Pistorius. Yes, she's off-colour, like the
            material about adopting an African child, but Cleese
            carries it off with an amoral, LA&nbsp;gold-digger persona
            that stays provocatively on the right side of caricature.</p>

          <p>Then come the digs at dad, which revolve around his <a href="             http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/may/06/john-cleese-review" title="">endless cycle of marriages and divorces</a>. "We
            have a new child in the family," she announces, then after
            a pause: "my new stepmother". Cue jokes about having a
            "mommy" who's not much older than she is – tart&nbsp;jabs
            with a distinct many-a-true-word air about them.</p>

          <p>It's an enjoyable set, and her co-stars just about
            maintain the standard. OK, so <a href="http://cortmccown.com/" title="">Cort McCown</a>
            frays the patience with sub-Doug Stanhope gender politics
            and his call for disciplinarian parenting. But&nbsp;he's a
            capable old-school club comic who manages to find new
            humour (who knew there was any left?) in material about
            Ryanair. And <a href="http://sarahtiana.com/" title="">Sarah Tiana</a> showcases a teasing set about
            being single, 36 and from the deep south. There's some way
            to go before UK audiences see Cleese as anything other than
            Basil Fawlty's daughter. But her fringe debut represents a
            decent start.</p>

          <p>• Until 13 August. Box office: 0131-226 1000. Venue: <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/american-ish" title="">Gilded Balloon</a>, Edinburgh.</p>

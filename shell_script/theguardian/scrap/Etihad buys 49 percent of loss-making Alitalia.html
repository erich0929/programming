                  <p> ROME (AP) â Fast-growing Gulf airline Etihad
                    Airways is to inject 560 million euros ($750
                    million) into Italy's loss-making national carrier
                    Alitalia, in a move that will see it gain access to
                    one of Europe's major markets.</p>

                  <p>Etihad, which is buying a 49 percent stake in the
                    Rome-based carrier, said Friday it will restructure
                    Alitalia and even laid out the hope of returning it
                    to profitability by 2017.</p>

                  <p>Etihad Airways CEO James Hogan announced the
                    three-year plan to completely reboot the Alitalia
                    brand at a press conference at a Rome hotel, saying
                    it was a strong airline but "a poor business
                    financially" that needed to be turned around.</p>

                  <p>"If we didn't believe Alitalia could restructure
                    and win we wouldn't be here," he said alongside his
                    Alitalia counterpart, Gabriele Del Torchio. "The
                    sexiest airline in Europe should be Alitalia."</p>

                  <p>The two signed the deal after months of
                    negotiations over debt restructuring, proposed job
                    cuts and other issues that sparked fierce
                    opposition from Italian unions. Airline workers
                    have staged wildcat strikes at Rome's main airport
                    this week to protest the deal.</p>

                  <p>The deal adds one of Europe's most recognizable
                    aviation brands to Etihad's growing collection of
                    foreign investments that also includes AirBerlin,
                    Air Seychelles, Virgin Australia, Aer Lingus, Air
                    Serbia and Jet Airways.</p>

                  <p>Etihad is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi,
                    the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates.</p>

                  <p>Hogan said the new airline would be able to
                    capitalize on Etihad's growing conglomerate to
                    reduce overhead and expand reach. Plans call for
                    beefing up Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport as a
                    hub, adding more long-haul routes and trimming back
                    less-performing shorter routes.</p>

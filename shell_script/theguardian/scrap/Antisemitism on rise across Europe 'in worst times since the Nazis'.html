              <p>In the space of just one week last month, according to
                Crif, the umbrella group for France's Jewish
                organisations, eight synagogues were attacked. One, in
                the Paris suburb of Sarcelles, was firebombed by a
                400-strong mob. A kosher supermarket and pharmacy were
                smashed and looted; the crowd's chants and banners
                included "Death to Jews" and "Slit Jews' throats". That
                same weekend, in the Barbes neighbourhood of the
                capital, stone-throwing protesters burned Israeli
                flags: "Israhell", read one banner.</p>

              <p>In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" title="More from the Guardian on Germany">Germany</a>
                last month, molotov cocktails were lobbed into the
                Bergische synagogue in Wuppertal – previously
                destroyed on Kristallnacht – and a Berlin imam, Abu
                Bilal Ismail, called on Allah to "destroy the Zionist
                Jews … Count them and kill them, to the very last
                one." Bottles were thrown through the window of an
                antisemitism campaigner in Frankfurt; an elderly Jewish
                man was beaten up at a pro-<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel" title="More from the Guardian on Israel">Israel</a>
                rally in Hamburg; an Orthodox Jewish teenager punched
                in the face in Berlin. In several cities, chants at
                pro-Palestinian protests compared Israel's actions to
                the Holocaust; other notable slogans included: "Jew,
                coward pig, come out and fight alone," and "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas" title="More from the Guardian on Hamas">Hamas</a>,
                Hamas, Jews to the&nbsp;gas."</p>

              <p>Across <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" title="More from the Guardian on Europe">Europe</a>,
                the conflict in Gaza is breathing new life into some
                very old, and very ugly, demons. This is not unusual;
                police and Jewish civil rights organisations have long
                observed a noticeable spike in antisemitic incidents
                each time the Israeli-Palestinian conflict flares.
                During the three weeks of Israel's Operation Cast Lead
                in late 2008 and early 2009, France recorded 66
                antisemitic incidents, including attacks on
                Jewish-owned restaurants and synagogues and a sharp
                increase in anti-Jewish graffiti.But according to
                academics and Jewish leaders, this time it is
                different. More than simply a reaction to the conflict,
                they say, the threats, hate speech and violent attacks
                feel like the expression of a much deeper and more
                widespread antisemitism, fuelled by a wide range of
                factors, that has been growing now for more than a
                decade.</p>

              <p>"These are the worst times since the Nazi era," Dieter
                Graumann, president of Germany's Central Council of
                Jews, told the Guardian. "On the streets, you hear
                things like 'the Jews should be gassed', 'the Jews
                should be burned' – we haven't had that in Germany
                for decades. Anyone saying those slogans isn't
                criticising Israeli politics, it's just pure hatred
                against Jews: nothing else. And it's not just a German
                phenomenon. It's an outbreak of hatred against Jews so
                intense that it's very clear indeed."</p>

              <p>Roger Cukierman, president of France's Crif, said
                French Jews were "anguished" about an anti-Jewish
                backlash that goes far beyond even strongly felt
                political and humanitarian opposition to the current
                fighting: "They are not screaming 'Death to the
                Israelis' on the streets of Paris," Cukierman said last
                month. "They are screaming 'Death to Jews'." Crif's
                vice-president Yonathan Arfi said he "utterly rejected"
                the view that the latest increase in antisemitic
                incidents was down to events in Gaza. "They have laid
                bare something far more profound," he said.</p>

              <p>Nor is it just Europe's Jewish leaders who are
                alarmed. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, has
                called the recent incidents "an attack on freedom and
                tolerance and our democratic state". The French prime
                minister, Manuel Valls, has spoken of "intolerable" and
                clearly antisemitic acts: "To attack a Jew because he
                is a Jew is to attack France. To attack a synagogue and
                a kosher grocery store is quite simply antisemitism and
                racism".</p>

              <p>France, whose 500,000-strong Jewish community is one
                of Europe's largest, and Germany, where the post-war
                exhortation of "Never Again" is part of the fabric of
                modern society, are not alone. In Austria last month, a
                pre-season friendly between Maccabi Haifa and German
                Bundesliga team SC Paderborn had to be rescheduled
                after the Israeli side's previous match was called off
                following an attempted assault on its players.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands" title="More from the Guardian on                 Netherlands">Netherlands</a>' main antisemitism
                watchdog, Cidi, had more than 70 calls from alarmed
                Jewish citizens in one week last month; the average is
                normally three to five. An Amsterdam rabbi, Binjamin
                Jacobs, had his front door stoned, and two Jewish women
                were attacked – one beaten, the other the victim of
                arson – after they hung Israeli flags from their
                balconies. In Belgium, a woman was reportedly turned
                away from a shop with the words: "We don't currently
                sell to Jews."</p>

              <p>In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy" title="More from the Guardian on Italy">Italy</a>, the
                Jewish owners of dozens of shops and other businesses
                in Rome arrived to find swastikas and anti-Jewish
                slogans daubed on shutters and windows. One slogan
                read: "Every Palestinian is like a comrade. Same enemy.
                Same barricade"; another: "Jews, your end is near." Abd
                al-Barr al-Rawdhi, an imam from the north eastern town
                of San Donà di Piave, is to be deported after being
                video-recorded giving a sermon calling for the
                extermination of the Jews.</p>

              <p>There has been no violence in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain" title="More from the Guardian on Spain">Spain</a>, but
                the country's small Jewish population of 35,000-40,000
                fears the situation is so tense that "if it continues
                for too long, bad things will happen," the leader of
                Madrid's Jewish community, David Hatchwell, said. The
                community is planning action against El Mundo after the
                daily paper published a column by 83-year-old
                playwright Antonio Gala questioning Jews' ability to
                live peacefully with others: "It's not strange they
                have been so frequently expelled."</p>

              <p>Studies suggest antisemitism may indeed be mounting. A
                2012 survey by the EU's by the Fundamental Rights
                agency of some 6,000 Jews in eight European countries
                – between them, home to 90% of Europe's Jewish
                population – found 66% of respondents felt
                antisemitism in Europe was on the rise; 76% said
                antisemitism had increased in their country over the
                past five years. In the 12 months after the survey,
                nearly half said they worried about being verbally
                insulted or attacked in public because they were
                Jewish.</p>

              <p>Jewish organisations that record antisemitic incidents
                say the trend is inexorable: France's Society for the
                Protection of the Jewish Community says annual totals
                of antisemitic acts in the 2000s are seven times higher
                than in the 1990s. French Jews are leaving for Israel
                in greater numbers, too, for reasons they say include
                antisemitism and the electoral success of the
                hard-right Front National. The Jewish Agency for Israel
                said 3,288 French Jews left for Israel in 2013, a 72%
                rise on the previous year. Between January and May this
                year, 2,254 left, against 580 in the same period last
                year.</p>

              <p>In a study completed in February, America's
                Anti-Defamation League surveyed 332,000 Europeans using
                an index of 11 questions designed to reveal strength of
                anti-Jewish stereotypes. It found that 24% of Europeans
                – 37% in France, 27% in Germany, 20% in Italy –
                harboured some kind of anti-Jewish attitude.</p>

              <p>So what is driving the phenomenon? Valls, the French
                prime minister, has acknowledged a "new", "normalised"
                antisemitism that he says blends "the Palestinian
                cause, jihadism, the devastation of Israel, and hatred
                of France and its values".</p>

              <p>Mark Gardner of the Community Security Trust, a
                London-based charity that monitors antisemitism both in
                Britain and on the continent, also identifies a range
                of factors. Successive conflicts in the Middle East he
                said, have served up "a crush of trigger events" that
                has prevented tempers from cooling: the second intifada
                in 2000, the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, and the three
                Israel–Hamas conflicts in 2009, 2012 and 2014 have
                "left no time for the situation to return to normal."
                In such a climate, he added, three brutal antisemitic
                murders in the past eight years – two in France, one
                in Belgium, and none coinciding with Israeli military
                action – have served "not to shock, but to encourage
                the antisemites", leaving them "seeking more blood and
                intimidation, not less".</p>

              Agency/Getty Images </span> </span>
              <p>In 2006, 23-year old Ilan Halimi was kidnapped,
                tortured and left for dead in Paris by a group calling
                itself the Barbarians Gang, who subsequently admitted
                targeting him "because he was a Jew, so his family
                would have money". Two years ago, in May 2012, Toulouse
                gunman Mohamed Merah shot dead seven people, including
                three children and a young rabbi outside their Jewish
                school. And in May this year Mehdi Nemmouche, a
                Frenchman of Algerian descent thought to have recently
                returned to France after a year in Syria fighting with
                radical Islamists, was charged with shooting four
                people at the Jewish museum in Brussels.</p>

              <p>If the French establishment has harboured a deep vein
                of anti-Jewish sentiment since long before the Dreyfus
                affair, the influence of radical Islam, many Jewish
                community leaders say, is plainly a significant
                contributing factor in the country's present-day
                antisemitism. But so too, said Gardner, is a
                straightforward alienation that many young Muslims feel
                from society. "Often it's more to do with that than
                with Israel. Many would as soon burn down a police
                station as a synagogue. Jews are simply identified as
                part of the establishment."</p>

              <p>While he stressed it would be wrong to lay all the
                blame at the feet of Muslims, Peter Ulrich, a research
                fellow at the centre for antisemitism research (ZfA) at
                Berlin's Technical University, agreed that some of the
                "antisemitic elements" Germany has seen at recent
                protests could be "a kind of rebellion of people who
                are themselves excluded on the basis of racist
                structures."</p>

              <p>Arfi said that in France antisemitism had become "a
                portmanteau for a lot of angry people: radical Muslims,
                alienated youths from immigrant families, the far
                right, the far left". But he also blamed "a process of
                normalisation, whereby antisemitism is being made
                somehow acceptable". One culprit, Arfi said, is the
                controversial comedian Dieudonné: "He has legitimised
                it. He's made acceptable what was unacceptable."</p>

              <p>A similar normalisation may be under way in Germany,
                according to a 2013 study by the Technical University
                of Berlin. In 14,000 hate-mail letters, emails and
                faxes sent over 10 years to the Israeli embassy in
                Berlin and the Central Council of Jews in Germany,
                Professor Monika Schwarz-Friesel found that 60% were
                written by educated, middle-class Germans, including
                professors, lawyers, priests and university and
                secondary school students. Most, too, were unafraid to
                give their names and addresses – something she felt
                few Germans would have done 20 or 30 years ago.</p>

              <p>Almost every observer pointed to the unparalleled
                power of unfiltered social media to inflame and to
                mobilise. A stream of shocking images and Twitter
                hashtags, including #HitlerWasRight, amount, Arfi said,
                almost to indoctrination. "The logical conclusion, in
                fact, is radicalisation: on social media people
                self-select what they see, and what they see can be
                pure, unchecked propaganda. They may never be
                confronted with opinions that are not their own."</p>

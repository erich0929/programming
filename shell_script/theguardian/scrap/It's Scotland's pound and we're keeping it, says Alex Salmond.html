              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond" title="More from the Guardian on Alex Salmond">Alex
                Salmond</a> has provoked a fresh battle over his plans
                for a Scottish currency after independence by declaring
                "it's our pound and we're keeping it".</p>

              <p>The first minister gave the clearest indication yet
                that an independent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland" title="More from the Guardian on Scotland">Scotland</a>
                would use <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling" title="More from the Guardian on Sterling">sterling</a>
                even if a formal sterling zone were rejected by the UK
                government – a controversial option known as
                dollarisation or the Panama option.</p>

              <p>As Scottish Labour lampooned Salmond by distributing
                leaflets shaped like a pound coin with his portrait
                replacing the Queen's head, the first minister insisted
                that the UK government would have no moral or political
                right to stop Scotland using sterling if it voted for
                independence.</p>

              <p>"We are keeping the pound in a currency union
                [because] we are appealing to the greatest authority of
                all – that is, the sovereign will of the people of
                Scotland," he told Holyrood, in a message pitched to
                appeal to grassroots nationalists and independence
                campaigners unnerved by his faltering performance in
                the televised debate on Tuesday.</p>

              <p>Renewing his threat to renege on Scotland's share of
                the UK's debt if the government in London refused to
                share sterling, Salmond added: "It is Scotland's pound.
                It doesn't belong to George Osborne, it doesn't belong
                to Ed Balls. It's Scotland's pound and we are keeping
                it."</p>

              <p>Salmond insisted that sharing sterling was in the UK's
                interests, because of the close integration of the
                Scottish and UK economies and high levels of
                cross-border trade – a stance backed by some senior
                Scottish business leaders and bankers.</p>

              <p>Opposition leaders retorted that a UK prime minister
                had a sovereign mandate to defend the interests of
                England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

              <p>"It is not for the first minister, no matter how
                limitless he thinks his powers are, to determine what
                is in the national interest of another country," said
                Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader.</p>

              <p>UK party leaders and Treasury mandarins have ruled out
                a deal on sterling because of the economic and
                political risks of underwriting another country's
                economy, insisting that sterling is not an asset but
                simply a system of exchange based on confidence in the
                bank that issues it, and trust in a government's
                ability to meet its debts.</p>

              <p>Salmond repeatedly insisted that his fight for a deal
                on using sterling was supported by his government's
                independence white paper, but that was immediately
                undermined after it emerged that the document contained
                a serious error of fact.</p>

              <p>It wrongly stated that the "continued use of sterling"
                would be "pegged and flexible". In fact, only a wholly
                new Scottish currency – a policy ruled out by Salmond
                – could be pegged to sterling or flexible, his
                spokesman admitted, before brushing off the mistake as
                "a typo".</p>

              <p>Salmond's tougher rhetoric on using sterling without a
                deal came after he repeatedly refused to set out his
                plan B options on currency during Tuesday's debate
                against the no campaign leader, Alistair Darling.</p>

              <p>With six weeks until the referendum and with the yes
                campaign more than 12 points behind, speculation is
                surfacing at Holyrood of a possible revolt against
                Salmond's leadership after the vote as senior unnamed
                figures in the party began criticising his tactics.</p>

              <p>He was forced to make a rallying speech to nervous
                ministers and backbenchers on Wednesday after a snap
                poll for the Guardian showed that viewers believed
                Darling had won by 56% to 44%, but his stance on a
                currency quickly came under fresh attack from one of
                the country's leading macroeconomists.</p>

              <p>Angus Armstrong, a former head of macroeconomics at
                the Treasury, said that using the pound informally,
                without having the Bank of England guaranteeing
                Scotland's financial sector as a lender of last resort,
                could force many of the big banks and financial
                institutions, such as RBS and Lloyds, to move to
                London.</p>

              <p>Financial services were Scotland's largest single
                export, worth £11bn – 15% of the country's balance
                of payments – but a vast majority of those sales were
                to the rest of the UK. Losing that business would hit
                Scotland's balance sheets, its GDP and the taxes paid
                into a Scottish exchequer.</p>

              <p>In a report for the National Institute for Economic
                and Social Research, Armstrong said an independent
                Scotland would instead need to build up its
                ownsubstantial emergency reserves as an insurance fund
                to back up its banks, which held about £120bn in
                deposits from Scottish customers. Creating that fund
                would immediately eat into a Scottish government's
                budgets.</p>

              <p>Armstrong added that his analysis was based on
                Scotland repaying its share of the UK's debt, even if
                the UK refused to agree a sterling pact. If an
                independent Scotland then refused to pay its share of
                the UK's debt, expected to hit £1.6tn by 2016, the EU
                could take a much tougher stance on Scotland's EU
                membership.</p>

              <p>Scotland's best option, he added, was to set up its
                own independence currency, or consider joining the
                euro.</p>

              <p>"You could do these things, yes. The question is at
                what cost," he said.</p>

              <p>"One of the costs of dollarisation is you give up
                having a fully functioning central bank; that matters
                for your banking system and when it's a big financial
                sector, that is going to matter for your balance of
                payments and therefore your economic prosperity."</p>

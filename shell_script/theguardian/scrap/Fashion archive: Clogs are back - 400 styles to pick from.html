              mid-century girl in the frozen food factory and is even,

              <p>The clog is back in the industrial North of England
                but it is no longer a simple, economic, and
                characteristic article of the mill girl's wardrobe.</p>

              <p>Clogs do not clatter along the tarmac as they once did
                along the cobbles. They are today a highly specialised
                product worn increasingly for safety in the heavy
                engineering industries. Clog-making, which is showing
                signs of a minor boom, has become a complex business. A
                Huddersfield clog factory, where more than a dozen
                people are employed, offers a range of 400 different
                types and prices to suit the whims and needs of the
                customers. The man who runs it, <a href="http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/frank-walkley-92-obituary-clogs-4936108">Mr
                Frank Walkley</a>, talks of clog "permutations," and
                says it is impossible to quote a sample price off the
                cuff unless he knows exactly what is needed; almost
                every order is supplied to meet a specific requirement.
                </p>

              <p>It is industrial firms, rather than individuals, who
                order Mr Walkley's products, which are now almost
                exclusively for factory wear. This year he expects to
                achieve a record production of 40,000 pairs and is
                hoping, if he can find the skilled craftsmen, to engage
                more staff.</p>

              <p>The pay can be extremely good. It is possible for an
                experienced worker to earn Â£20 a week. But the
                applicants, though experienced, are not always suitable
                for the demands of what has become again a "modern"
                industry. Some are sixty or seventy years old; others
                are cobblers who want to make a few clogs on their own
                premises in their own time. Mr Walkley is at the moment
                trying to bring back from Canada a skilled, emigrant
                clog-maker.</p>

              <p>The business which he founded in a Huddersfield
                back-yard when he was demobilised from the Royal Tank
                Corps after the war, and ran single-handed, is
                receiving inquiries from factories all over Britain.
                For heavy industrial workers he has produced a basic
                clog with part of the uppers reinforced with steel. For
                women, he has produced a lighter version which, still
                having the old property of being warm in winter, is
                ideal for the mid-century girl in the frozen food
                factory and is even, it seems, used around the home.</p>

              <p> At present Mr Walkley, who has already moved his
                factory once, is again looking for bigger premises.
                There are two other firms, one in the north and the
                other in London, producing clogs in large quantities.
                Only one door, apparently, is closed to this new, old
                Industry: the door to the export market. Mr Walkley
                went to Dusseldorf to examine possibilities of European
                trade, but found that most countries were amply
                equipped to meet their own demands for clogs.</p>

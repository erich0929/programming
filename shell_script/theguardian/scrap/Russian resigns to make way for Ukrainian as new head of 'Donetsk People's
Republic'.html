                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>The Russian prime minister of the self-proclaimed
                    Donetsk People’s Republic has announced his
                    resignation in a move aimed at dampening claims
                    that the rebellion in eastern Ukraine is being
                    masterminded by Moscow.</p>

                  <p>Borodai, a Russian national, steps down <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/rebel-fighter-speaks-out-against-east-ukraine-separatist-leaders/504620.html">amid
                    growing tensions from within the separatists’
                    ranks</a> and as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/ukraine-revolution-dream-stalling-war-east">Ukrainian
                    government forces move to encircle the city of
                    Donetsk</a>. <br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>He will be replaced by Alexander Zakharchenko, a
                    Ukrainian citizen from Donetsk Oblast and member of
                    the militant group Oplot, who has been a major
                    player in the insurgency against Kiev’s
                    government forces since its military offensive
                    began in April.</p>

                  <p>Wearing a black t-shirt with his trademark blue
                    blazer, Borodai told journalists inside the rebel
                    headquarters in Donetsk yesterday that he came to
                    eastern Ukraine “as a crisis manager,” and
                    claimed that under his leadership “the Donetsk
                    People’s Republic became a state.”</p>

                  <p>Flanked by Zakharchenko, Borodai said, “I am a
                    Muscovite. Donbass should be led by a genuine
                    Donetsk native.”</p>

                  <p>However, Borodai made it clear that he would
                    remain closely involved. He added “that even if I
                    spend much of my time in Moscow I will serve” the
                    self-styled republic as first deputy prime minister
                    and an advisor to Zakharchenko, who wore a striped
                    t-shirt of the kind worn by the Russian navy, and
                    the cross of St George, a Russian military
                    decoration.</p>

                  <p>Borodai is one of many Russian citizens with close
                    ties to Moscow and Russian intelligence services.
                    Before arriving in eastern Ukraine, he <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/802b9b20-eb0e-11e3-bab6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz39hMCTTLT">was
                    an advisor to Sergey Aksyonov</a>, the <a href="http://time.com/19097/putin-crimea-russia-ukraine-aksyonov/">current
                    acting head of Crimea</a> appointed by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Russian
                    President Vladimir Putin</a> following Russia’s
                    annexation of Crimea in March, and a consultant for
                    an investment fund in Moscow, where he also owns a
                    restaurant chain.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>He is also a close confidant of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/three-pro-russia-rebel-leaders-suspects-over-downed-mh17">Igor
                    Girkin, better known by his nom de guerre Strelkov,
                    meaning “the shooter,”</a> who is the military
                    commander of the Donetsk region. The two men, both
                    Muscovites, fought together in Moldova’s
                    breakaway region of Transnistria in the early
                    1990s.</p>

                  <p>Borodai’s departure comes on the heels of a
                    recent trip to Moscow, where he spent several days
                    tending to “business related to the [Donetsk
                    People’s Republic.]”</p>

                  <p>Speaking for the first time in his new role as
                    prime minister of the self-declared republic,
                    Zakharchenko described the escalating standoff with
                    Ukraine’s military by saying: “The situation is
                    indeed difficult but not critical.”<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Events earlier in the day, however, highlighted
                    the intensifying situation in Ukraine’s restive
                    east, where rebels have suffered significant losses
                    at the hands of Kiev’s forces in recent weeks.</p>

                  <p>In Donetsk, local authorities urged residents to
                    use “maximum caution” and stay indoors as a
                    barrage of shells rained down near the city’s
                    security services building, which is used as a base
                    by the rebels. At least one person was reportedly
                    killed.</p>

                  <p>Several kilometres north of Donetsk, government
                    forces moved at least two dozen tanks and artillery
                    to a high point on the hills, where they fired
                    salvos of shells toward the rebel-held city of
                    Horlivka. Thunderous booms shook homes and echoed
                    through the valleys below, as thick black smoke
                    rose from the city of some 250,000 people.</p>

                  <p>The Horlivka city council said in a statement
                    shortly after that five people were killed when a
                    shell hit near a bus stop.</p>

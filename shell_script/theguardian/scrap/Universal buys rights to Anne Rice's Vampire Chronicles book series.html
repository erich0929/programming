                <div class="flexible-content-body" data-display-hint="">
                  <p>The undying reign of vampire films looks set to
                    continue as Universal Pictures acquires the movie
                    rights to Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles series
                    of 13 novels.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Rice’s son Christopher is also involved, with
                    the deal including the screenplay he adapted from
                    his mother’s book Tale of the Body Thief. Alex
                    Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, producers of the recent
                    Transformers and Star Trek movies, will oversee the
                    series.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>It follows an impressive number of vampire book
                    series that have been adapted for film or
                    television over the past decade, trying to cater to
                    an audience whose thirst is seemingly insatiable.
                    The flurry of vampire flicks include the Twilight
                    saga, 30 Days of Night (2007) and Van Helsing
                    (2004), as well as the forthcoming Dracula Untold
                    movie. The television series The Vampire Diaries
                    and True Blood have also had strong followings in
                    recent years.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Rice’s debut novel in the series, Interview With
                    the Vampire, was adapted into a dramatically gothic
                    film directed by Neil Jordan in 1994, starring Tom
                    Cruise, Brad Pitt and a young Kirsten Dunst – it
                    grossed $224m globally.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>However, in 2002, Rice’s book Queen of the
                    Damned, also part of the Vampire Chronicles, was
                    adapted into a film starring Aaliyah and Stuart
                    Townsend. It has become something of a cult hit in
                    the wake of Aaliyah’s death, but the film
                    underperformed at the box office and has a measly
                    17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>Universal is investing heavily in the supernatural
                    genre at the moment, and recently embarked on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/17/universal-pictures-movie-monsters-frankenstein-invisible-man">a
                    project with Kurtzman and Chris Morgan</a> to
                    breathe new life into classic movie characters such
                    as Dracula, the Mummy and Frankenstein’s monster.
                    The Mummy is up first, with a film scheduled for
                    release on April 22, 2016.<br/>

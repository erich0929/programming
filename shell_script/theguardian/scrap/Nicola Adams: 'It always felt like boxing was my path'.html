              women weren't allowed to be boxers. Now she's won Olympic
              and Commonwealth gold. Here she talks about making
              history against the odds – and why she still won't call
              herself a feminist</div>

<div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Sunglasses on and leaning moodily against a wall for
                the photographer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nicola-adams" title="More from the Guardian on Nicola Adams">Nicola
                Adams</a> looks every inch the sleek, stylish
                celebrity. At just 5ft 4in, and with a fighting weight
                of 51kg she's small, slight and carefully dressed. Then
                she bends down to unzip her white trainers for the
                camera and her face relaxes into a grin, "I'd better
                remember I've done this or I'll fall on my face," she
                laughs.</p>

              <p>It's a typical Adams moment; puncturing any hint of
                self-importance. In 2012 she was the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/nicola-adams-olympic-boxing-gold" title="">first female boxer to&nbsp;win a gold medal at
                the Olympic Games</a>. Asked how she would celebrate
                her win, she told a stunned-looking commentator,
                "I&nbsp;think I just want to go&nbsp;to Nando's."</p>

              <p>Two years later, she is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/01/nicola-adams-commonwealth-games-flyweight-boxing-final" title="">the first female boxing champion at the
                Commonwealth games</a>. "To create history once in your
                lifetime is amazing, but to do it twice
                is&nbsp;unbelievable," she tells me over
                a&nbsp;cup&nbsp;of coffee (a vanilla latte with extra
                cream – she is taking a break from her usual strict
                diet).</p>

              <p>Despite Usain Bolt <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/30/usain-bolt-commonwealth-games-2014" title="">reportedly calling the Commonwealth Games a
                "bit shit"</a>, Adams insists that winning gold felt
                even better than it did at the Olympics. "I thought I
                would feel exactly the same, but actually it feels more
                … " she trails off trying to express the enormity of
                it. "It could still be sinking in, but to actually do
                it again feels surreal."</p>

              <p>Going into an international competition as an
                established champion,&nbsp;rather than the scrappy
                outsider, piled on the expectations. "Winning Olympic
                gold put me in everyone's focus," she says. "It's hard
                when everyone thinks you will sail through, because you
                are the person who has to do it. It's a good thing
                I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;feel pressure in a big way because
                otherwise I would have crumbled."</p>

              <p>One of the reason's Adams seems so impressive is that
                she always makes a tough fight look easy. In the ring,
                she makes sure she is happy, relaxed and smiling so her
                opponents never see her&nbsp;nervous, and they know
                that she has&nbsp;full confidence in a win. "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing" title="More from the Guardian on Boxing">Boxing</a>
                is&nbsp;certainly not about going in, seeing a&nbsp;red
                mist and throwing punches," she explains. "If you do
                that, you will get caught. The first thing you learn is
                defence – and there is a lot of technique&nbsp;to
                master."</p>

              <p>When&nbsp;I ask her about being a bisexual black woman
                in such a macho sport, she insists there have been no
                problems. Today she is happy to admit she is in a
                relationship ("I think it's nice to show different
                sides of me," she says), but agrees that when she first
                arrived in the public eye she was wary of talking about
                her sexuality.</p>

              <p>"When I started doing interviews I&nbsp;never knew
                what to say, so I never mentioned it. But I started to
                feel like I&nbsp;was going into myself. I didn't want
                to&nbsp;hide anything – it's not something
                I&nbsp;would ever hide, and I don't want people to
                think I am ashamed of it."</p>

              <p>Her family knew she was bisexual from the age of 16 or
                17, and "it&nbsp;was never a big deal". Of course, she
                was nervous about telling her mother, she says, but "it
                was fine". Later I speak to Adams's mother on&nbsp;the
                phone, and she laughs about how drama-free the
                coming-out conversation was. "I kind of knew she was
                bisexual already, but I&nbsp;wasn't sure," she tells
                me. "I just said to her: 'I'm going to make a cup of
                tea now, do you want one?' It sounds terrible when she
                was telling me something so big, but what was there
                to&nbsp;say? We just carried on as normal."</p>

              during the difficult times she had following her parents'
              split. Photograph: Colorsport/Corbis </span> </span>
              <p>Adams was brought up on a council estate in
                Burmantofts Leeds, which she describes as "not the
                roughest, but rough enough" thanks to the local kids'
                fondness for nicking cars. She was always a tomboy, and
                adored watching videos of the old fights of Sugar Ray
                Leonard and Muhammad Ali, with her father, Innocent.
                But then, when she was 12 years old, her parents split
                up and her father and older half-brother moved out. "I
                missed them, and it was a&nbsp;difficult time. I'd see
                my friends, and their parents were still together while
                mine had split up. I was angry at times."</p>

              <p>The local boxing gym became a&nbsp;refuge, she says.
                "I only went into a&nbsp;gym by accident. My mum
                couldn't get a babysitter and wanted to do aerobics, so
                she took me and Kurtis, my younger brother, down to the
                gym. There was an&nbsp;after-school boxing class on
                with some of the kids from school." By the end of
                that&nbsp;first session, Adams couldn't wait to go
                back. "There weren't any other girls there, but&nbsp;I
                didn't mind," she says, "I loved it." Her mother, she
                says, was happy to&nbsp;see her off the streets. "She
                wasn't worried," Adams laughs, "because the first time
                she saw me spar, I was beating up the boys."</p>

              <p>The club gave her an escape from the&nbsp;upheaval at
                home and became, "almost like another family", one
                where her coaches became father figures for her. More
                importantly, Adams, still barely a teenager, felt she
                had discovered what she wanted to do with her life.
                "Even though women's boxing wasn't an Olympic sport
                then, I knew I&nbsp;would be an Olympic champion. Most
                people must've thought, 'It's never going to happen.'
                So&nbsp;I don't know why … it just felt like that was
                my path, and that one day I&nbsp;would achieve it."</p>

              <p>What makes her ambition all the more extraordinary was
                the dire state of women's boxing at the time. Until
                1996 it had been banned for a staggering 116&nbsp;years
                by the Amateur Boxing Association of England. And when
                the first amateur bout was announced in 1997 – a year
                after Adams started her after-school class – the
                contest, between two 13-year-old girls, was dubbed
                a&nbsp;"freakshow" by high-profile boxing managers, and
                denounced as something that would only be watched by
                "yobbos" for titillation.</p>

              <p>Looking back, it can be hard to remember the strength
                of the opposition. Even as late as 2008, Jane Couch,
                the then British welterweight champion of the world,
                had to go to a tribunal to overturn a ban on her
                fighting in the UK. The court was told the British
                Boxing Board of Control believed that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/pmt-makes-women-unfit-to-box-1144391.html" title="">PMT made women too unstable to fight</a>.</p>

              <p>When it was finally announced as an Olympic sport in
                2009, former Olympic medallist Amir Khan declared that,
                "deep down I think women shouldn't fight," while the
                Amateur International Boxing Association suggested <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/17229496" title="">women boxers should wear skirts</a>, with some
                coaches claiming this would make them&nbsp;seem more
                "elegant".</p>

              <p>Adams acknowledges that women have "always had to
                fight" for equality, and makes a link between the
                struggle of women boxers, and the struggle for women to
                get the vote. Yet despite this,&nbsp;she says "I
                wouldn't call myself a&nbsp;feminist", and for a moment
                her smile&nbsp;falters.</p>

              <p>"I am just me," she says, frustrated by the line of
                questioning. "I like boxing and acting and doing my
                charity work." She says she doesn't think that girls
                are put off sport because of the scrutiny around female
                appearance – "I wasn't" – and, perhaps because of
                her lower profile (or tougher image), says she has
                never faced the sort of criticism or insults that
                Rebecca Adlington has endured. Even if she did, she
                says, she would ignore them. "My family and friends are
                the only people I pay mind to," she says firmly. "It's
                none of my business what anyone else thinks.
                I&nbsp;don't even know them, so why
                should&nbsp;I&nbsp;care?"</p>

              to video: Nicola Adams' family react to her becoming the
              first female Olympic champion boxer</a> </span>
              <p>There were plenty of challenges Adams says, but
                throughout her early career she remained adamant that
                she would succeed. Partly, this was down to the immense
                support from her family. "My mum did really well
                raising me and my brother by&nbsp;herself. I know it
                was a&nbsp;struggle, and&nbsp;even from a young age,
                when I&nbsp;was&nbsp;boxing, it was always to make
                my&nbsp;mother proud."</p>

              <p>Their bond was strengthened when Adams was 13 and her
                mother fell dangerously ill with meningitis.
                Adams&nbsp;was left to care for her, and Kurtis, who
                was still in primary school. "We thought she was going
                to die," she remembers. "She was really sick, weak, and
                in a lot of pain. I was scared about how me and my
                brother would survive. Who would look after us? Would
                we move and change schools? I just knew I&nbsp;had to
                help and do the&nbsp;things she couldn't. So I got the
                shopping in, washed clothes, cooked, did my homework. I
                went to school as normal, picked my brother up
                afterwards and went to the hospital to see my mum.
                I&nbsp;just tried to reassure Mum that everything was
                fine."</p>

              <p>Her mother made a full recovery, but&nbsp;as Adams'
                boxing skills improved, the costs of her training and
                equipment became almost crippling. Her mother, who
                worked as a restaurant manager until 11pm or midnight,
                found it hard to&nbsp;make ends meet, and although she
                worked tirelessly to keep her daughter in the minds of
                funding bodies and the media, no money was forthcoming.
                Instead Adams took on a series of jobs, from working on
                a building site to being an extra on Emmerdale and
                Coronation Street, and between them the family managed
                to cover the costs of sending her to international
                competitions. Today&nbsp;the pair are still very close,
                and Adams admits that her mother calls her&nbsp;a
                mummy's girl – "but she's the only one allowed to
                call me that!"</p>

              <p>The family's toughest test came in 2009, when Adams
                fell down the stairs at her home while rushing to get
                to a fight on time. She carried on regardless, and won
                the match, but after days of increasing pain she
                discovered she had broken a bone in&nbsp;her back,
                which left her bed-ridden for three months. "It was the
                toughest thing I have faced. I felt like giving up.
                I&nbsp;didn't think I would be able to box again,
                although the doctors had told me&nbsp;I would. I just
                didn't see how I&nbsp;could get there.</p>

              <p>When it came to the last trial for the Team GB squad,
                Adams was told she had to take part to have a chance,
                despite not having boxed for a year. "I was on morphine
                patches," she remembers. "I&nbsp;was supposed to just
                have one, but I&nbsp;stuck two on my arm, took some
                pills and thought: 'I am just going to do it.' Luckily
                they saw something there. But for the whole weekend
                after that I&nbsp;couldn't move at all – I was in so
                much&nbsp;pain."</p>

              <p>Now, despite the physical demands of her career, she
                says she would consider starting a family herself.
                "Mary Kom [the Indian five times World Amateur Champion
                boxer] had twins and still won a medal," she points
                out. "She's just had another child and is still
                coming&nbsp;back into the sport."</p>

              <p>But for the moment, she is concentrating on boxing.
                She has still only won a silver medal at the World
                Amateur Championships, and wants to rectify that. Then
                there is the small matter of the 2016 Rio Games, which
                she&nbsp;hopes will make her the first British boxer to
                be&nbsp;a double Olympic champion. Oh, and she wouldn't
                mind starring in an action&nbsp;movie like the Fast and
                the Furious franchise.</p>

              <p>On top of all that, there is the temptation to turn
                professional, and take part in money-making fights, as
                Amir Khan has now done. That could be&nbsp;a tricky
                prospect because there are only a handful of
                professional female boxers in the UK and it might be
                difficult for her to find enough competitors of her
                calibre. "But I guess it just takes a&nbsp;few big
                names to change that," she muses. "Maybe I will be the
                first there as&nbsp;well," she laughs. And who would
                dare to argue?</p>

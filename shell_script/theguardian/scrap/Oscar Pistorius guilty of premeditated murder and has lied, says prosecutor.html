              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/oscar-pistorius" title="More from the Guardian on Oscar Pistorius">Oscar
                Pistorius</a> must be found guilty of the premeditated
                murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, South African
                prosecutors have said, as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live" title="">the athlete's testimony at his trial was
                dismissed as mendacious and "devoid of truth"</a>.</p>

              <p>Prosecutor <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/12/barry-roux-gerrie-nel-oscar-pistorius-trial" title="">Gerrie Nel</a>, making his closing argument
                for the state, said the defence claim that Pistorius
                believed there was an intruder in his house on the
                night of 14 February 2013 would not help him escape
                conviction: "[If] I know there is a human being behind
                that door. I mean to kill that person and I do so," Nel
                said. "That it turned out to be Reeva is [legally] of
                no consequence."</p>

              <p>Defence lawyers, Nel said, are set to argue that
                Pistorius acted in self-defence, faced with a perceived
                intruder, but also that he fired involuntarily because
                he was startled. "It's two defences that you can never
                reconcile," Nel told the judge, Thokozile Masipa, who
                will retire on Friday to consider her verdict. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e29a86e4b0c8aa99e2b0ba" title="">There is no jury.</a></p>

              <p>At the high court in Pretoria, Nel repeatedly accused
                Pistorius of tailoring his evidence, saying that
                contested claims about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e33f81e4b0489f499be6d2" title="">the location of a duvet and two fans</a> in
                the athlete's bedroom and inconsistencies in his
                version of events on the night were the consequence of
                a "snowball effect of lies".</p>

              <p>"The court should have no difficulty in rejecting his
                full version of events, not only as not reasonably
                possibly true, but in essence as being absolutely
                devoid of any truth," Nel told the court.</p>

              <p>"It's a snowball effect of lies. You tell one and it
                becomes too much. You just have to keep going and
                going."</p>

              <p>The prosecution contends that – contrary to
                Pistorius's claim that the couple went to bed at 10pm
                – the pair were in fact awake and arguing.</p>

              <p>A witness says she heard a row, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36ab1e4b047cac37a56ee" title="">Steenkamp's stomach contents indicated that
                she was awake</a> and eating at around 1am, Nel said.</p>

              <p>Neighbours heard "intermingling" screams of a man and
                a woman before the four gunshots.</p>

              <p>Barry Roux, for the defence, will make his main
                closing argument on Friday. But he took advantage of an
                extension to the court day on Thursday to point out
                what he called "mistakes" in the state's version.</p>

              <p>He told the court that the original investigating
                officer, Hilton Botha, told "blatant lies" and argued
                that police had moved crucial evidence at the scene,
                saying that the defence would show the judge a
                photograph of one of the officers with his hand on a
                plug.</p>

              <p>Friday's hearing is likely to focus on the timeline of
                events around the shooting, amid claims by Roux that
                the state's case "takes a nosedive" over the timing of
                the gunshots.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e36979e4b03f89077d888d" title="">The state says the four shots were fired at
                3.17am</a>; the defence says this noise was the cricket
                bat breaking down the toilet door, and earlier sounds
                heard by neighbours were the shots.</p>

              <p>The state has not provided an alternative explanation
                for the earlier noises, but its argument that
                neighbours heard female screams rests on the fatal
                shots being fired no earlier than 3.17am. The court has
                heard that Steenkamp would have been unable to cry out
                once she had been shot.</p>

              <p>For the first time since the trial began in March, the
                fathers of Pistorius and Steenkamp were in the Pretoria
                courthouse. Pistorius is said to be estranged from his
                father, Henke, and Steenkamp's father, Barry, has been
                ill.</p>

              <p>As well as the murder charge, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/07/oscar-pistorius-trial-closing-arguments-live#block-53e2a28ae4b036294986ece4" title="">Pistorius is also charged with having
                committed other offences</a> – of discharging a
                firearm in a public place and illegal possession of
                ammunition. These alleged offences, argues the state,
                show a pattern of behaviour in which the athlete acts
                recklessly and does not take responsibility for his
                actions.</p>

              <p>Pistorius denies all the charges laid against him.</p>

              <p>Readers of the New York Times will have to steel
                themselves this weekend, as the unseemly brawl between
                Hachette and Amazon erupts on to the tranquil pages of
                the Grey Lady. Perhaps the most incendiary item in
                Sunday's edition is due to be a full-page ad paid for
                by a group of bestselling authors – and backed by
                over 900 other writers – calling on Amazon "in the
                strongest possible terms to stop harming the livelihood
                of the authors on whom it has built its business".</p>

              <p>The extraordinary move is the latest salvo in a battle
                over terms which has seen <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/23/amazon-escalates-battle-hachette-publishing" title="">Amazon delay delivery and remove the
                possibility of pre-orders</a> on a swathe of books by
                Hachette authors, including JK Rowling and James
                Patterson. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx3J0JKSSUIRCMT" title="">The online leviathan Amazon</a> says it is
                attempting to "lower ebook prices"; publishing
                conglomerate Hachette argues that it is seeking "terms
                that value appropriately for the years ahead the
                author's unique role in creating books, and the
                publisher's role in editing, marketing, and
                distributing them".</p>

              <p>Both sides have gradually sharpened their rhetoric
                over recent weeks, with Hachette saying that it would
                be suicidal to accept Amazon's proposals, and Amazon
                that Hachette should "<a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/63406-amazon-makes-plea-to-authors-to-quiet-down.html" title="">stop using their authors as human
                shields</a>".</p>

              <p>Authors have moved to take sides in the debate, with
                the bestselling writer Douglas Preston collecting over
                <a href="http://authorsunited.net/" title="">900
                signatures to a letter</a> – the text of which is due
                to appear in Sunday's advertisement – calling on
                readers to contact Amazon's Jeff Bezos "and tell him
                what you think" about the situation.</p>

              <p>"As writers – most of us not published by Hachette
                – we feel strongly that no bookseller should block
                the sale of books or otherwise prevent or discourage
                customers from ordering or receiving the books they
                want. It is not right for Amazon to single out a group
                of authors, who are not involved in the dispute, for
                selective retaliation. Moreover, by inconveniencing and
                misleading its own customers with unfair pricing and
                delayed delivery, Amazon is contradicting its own
                written promise to be 'Earth's most customer-centric
                company'," write the authors, who include Stephen King,
                Donna Tartt, Paul Auster, Barbara Kingsolver and a host
                of other well-known names.</p>

              <p>Preston told the Guardian that the ad had been funded
                "by a small group of authors". According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html" title="">New York Times</a>, it cost $104,000.</p>

              <p>Last month, Amazon described Preston as "an
                opportunist who seeks readers' support while actively
                working against their interests".</p>

              <p>Preston asked "exactly what opportunity it is that I
                am supposed to be seizing—the opportunity to be
                disparaged by one of the largest corporations in the
                world? All we are asking is for Amazon to settle its
                differences with Hachette without hurting authors and
                holding books hostage."</p>

              <p>Authors, he said, "have nothing to do with this
                dispute. Why has Amazon dragged us into this? What
                Amazon is doing to authors is wrong, it is unfair, and
                it is unacceptable. It is Amazon who is actively
                working against the interests of readers by denying
                them books."</p>

              <p>According to the New York Times, since the dispute
                with Amazon began, Preston's "paperback sales are down
                61 percent and his e-book sales are down 62 percent".</p>

              <p>Amazon have not responded to the Guardian's request
                for comment.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/24/sophie-hannah-top-10-pageturners" title="">British thriller writer Sophie Hannah</a> said
                she signed the letter "because it seems to me that
                continuing business as usual while negotiations take
                place is a good idea. It's a sign of good faith. 'Look
                how great things are and can remain' sends a jollier
                and more helpful message than 'Look how bad things
                might get.'"</p>

              <p>Kamila Shamsie, another signatory, felt that "all
                writers should be deeply concerned by the strong-arm
                tactics Amazon is using in its contractual dispute with
                Hachette – similar to tactics used in 2008 with
                Bloomsbury titles".</p>

              <p>"Writers want their books to reach readers; and we
                want to be able to earn a living from our work – it's
                a great irony that the world's largest bookseller is
                prepared to trample over both those wants in order to
                gain a business advantage even while claiming to stand
                up for readers and writers," said Shamsie.</p>

              <p>Other authors disagree, with <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/indie-authors-launch-pro-amazon-petition.html" title="">a petition to Hachette launched by major names
                in self-publishing</a> including Barry Eisler and Hugh
                Howey asking the publisher to "work on a resolution
                that keeps ebook prices reasonable and pays authors a
                fair wage" gathering over 7,600 signatures.</p>

              <p>Eisler said that Sunday's ad "will have nothing to do
                with improving publishing for everyone, and everything
                to do with preserving publishing for a select few".</p>

              <p>"When James Patterson and Douglas Preston and Richard
                Russo and Scott Turow tell you they're trying to
                protect your interests, they're conning you. Whether
                they're also conning themselves, I don't know. Don't
                judge them by their rhetoric; judge them by their
                behaviour. And by their behaviour you can see they have
                no interest at all in improving publishing for
                everyone. Only in preserving it for themselves," said
                the novelist.</p>

              <p>He added that "beyond that, maybe the most notable
                thing about the New York Times ad is that it
                demonstrates how the top one percent of authors are
                able to buy their desired media access. For them, a New
                York Times ad is about the equivalent of a cup of
                coffee for anyone else, the difference being that the
                ad leads to a ton of follow-on media coverage."</p>

              <p>Eisler said the fight was "asymmetrical", but that
                "the forces of publishing progress have on their side
                both numbers and coherence". "Over time, I'm confident
                numbers and coherence will prevail over money and star
                power. But it'll require commitment, because a defining
                characteristic of all establishments is that they will
                never reform without a hell of a fight," he said.</p>

              <p>Another signatory to the petition to Hachette, the
                writer Orna Ross – founder of the Alliance of
                Independent Authors – said that "setting authors in
                opposition to each other, or to any service that is
                useful to them, is unhelpful".</p>

              <p>"This is a dispute between two large author-service
                companies. Authors should be guided by what is best for
                the writing and reading community, not what is best for
                the publishing industry," she added.</p>

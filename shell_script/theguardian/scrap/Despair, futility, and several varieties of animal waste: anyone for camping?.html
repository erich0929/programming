                  <p>When Jean-Paul Sartre wrote in his 1944 play <a href="https://archive.org/stream/NoExit/NoExit_djvu.txt" title="">Huis Clos</a> that “hell is other
                    people” , it’s probably safe to assume that he
                    had never been camping.</p>

                  <p>While the thought of the great Left Bank
                    pontificator struggling to erect a tent through
                    driving rain in a murky Welsh field is
                    intrinsically amusing, the sense of existential
                    despair that camping elicits is not. The futility
                    of human existence is roundly brought home when,
                    after pitching your tent, you get into a spat with
                    your neighbours about toilet access, only to find
                    that the next morning their dog has taken a very
                    large dump just outside your tent. At least you
                    assume it was the dog. An uneasy truce develops
                    but, frankly, your weekend in the countryside is
                    ruined before it’s even begun.</p>

                  <p>I first camped in 1987 at <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/" title="">Glastonbury</a>, and though festival
                    camping is not typical of the experience as a
                    whole, it set a disastrous precedent that each
                    subsequent trip has, to a greater or lesser degree,
                    followed. A friend and I had hitched down, arriving
                    at midnight to try to put up a monstrosity of
                    canvas and wood – the type of thing that a
                    three-year-old might draw if you asked them what a
                    tent looked like. When I stuck my head out the next
                    morning, I discovered one of Michael Eavis’s
                    Holstein-Friesians unleashing a hot torrent of
                    urine down the side of it. If this is what camping
                    is like, I said to myself, you can keep it, and
                    there has been very little in the intervening years
                    to make me change my mind.</p>

                  <p>Despite this I probably go camping two or three
                    times each summer, mostly because my partner loves
                    to sleep out under the stars. No greater love hath
                    a man for a woman than that he would lay down with
                    her on a wheezy air mattress in a garishly coloured
                    nylon coffin. But the joy of camping, the simple
                    pleasure in it that other people seem to take, has
                    always managed to evade me. In fact I can’t think
                    of anything less pleasurable.</p>

                  <p>A typical trip will begin with a fruitless
                    excursion to the attic to see if that’s where we
                    threw everything last September. A succession of
                    minor squabbles about who is responsible for losing
                    the mallet or forgetting to dry out the tent after
                    the last trip ensures that you get off to the best
                    possible start. Packing the car takes almost as
                    long as the journey itself and, when you arrive,
                    it’s clear that all the best pitches have already
                    been taken. Once you put up your tent (another
                    squabble) and unpack all the food you won’t eat
                    and the alcohol that you will run out of, you check
                    out your nearest neighbours: on one side is a
                    middle-aged couple who sit at their folding table
                    without exchanging a word as they sip their drinks,
                    before retiring at 8pm precisely, and on the other
                    a large, boisterous family whose children
                    constantly kick their ball across your pitch and
                    who have taken advantage of the electrical hook-up
                    to have a TV blaring.</p>

                  <p>It seems almost inexplicable that someone would
                    bring a TV with them on a camping trip, but the
                    more you camp the more you begin to understand it.
                    Because the big secret about camping is that it is
                    boring. Profoundly, mind-numbingly boring. There is
                    absolutely nothing to do. You may think you are
                    going to spend a few days living a cosy bucolic
                    idyll, but the reality is that you’re renting a
                    few feet of muddy field from a farmer who’s
                    decided to diversify by buying a prefab toilet
                    block and pretending it’s a functioning bathroom.
                    Once you’ve got up ludicrously early and burned
                    your breakfast, you’re basically killing time
                    until you can decently start to drink yourself into
                    oblivion again.</p>

                  <p>You could go for a walk, of course, and take in
                    the majesty of the natural British countryside, but
                    unfortunately there is nothing natural about it.
                    That cosy bucolic idyll is a Victorian fantasy. We
                    flee our crowded, built-up cities and towns to
                    pitch our tents side by side in another equally
                    manmade environment, to live cheek by jowl for a
                    few days with people we wouldn’t normally give
                    the time of day to, thinking that we’re getting
                    away from it all. But unfortunately we and our
                    neighbours on the campsite ensure that it all comes
                    with us.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps Sartre wasn’t so wrong after all: hell
                    is simply other people camping.</p>

                  <p>In “honour” of senior government minister Eric
                    Abetz’s ability to completely disregard modern
                    medical research and science – he <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BueBQVQCMAAhPlb.jpg:large">favours
                    questionable studies dating back to the 50s</a>
                    that he claims show a link between abortion and
                    breast cancer – Guardian Australia has revived
                    other previously held but spectacularly wrong
                    beliefs about health from that era.</p>

                  <p>Virtually every major health organisation and
                    professional body has carried out extensive
                    analysis on studies linking breast cancer and
                    abortion, and have unanimously agreed that there is
                    no causative link.</p>

                  <p>While no one seems to have told Abetz that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jan/06/correlation-causation">association
                    does not always equal causation</a>, let’s join
                    him in disregarding this essential mantra of
                    science for a moment to consider;</p>

                  <h2><strong>Thalidomide</strong></h2>

                  <p>Thousands of babies were born limbless, with
                    spinal cord defects, and heart and genital
                    abnormalities, because this sedative was widely
                    prescribed to mothers in the 50s to offer relief
                    from morning sickness. By 1961 it became apparent
                    that the drug was causing the horrific effects in
                    children, and it was widely banned.</p>

                  <p>But the effects of ignoring what we now know about
                    the drug are devastating. Thalidomide is still
                    sometimes used for the treatment of leprosy –
                    including in pregnant women – <a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1.full">in
                    rural areas</a> of the world that lack resources.
                    Babies are continuing to be born suffering from the
                    effects of the drug.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Lobotomies</strong></h2>

                  <p>For two decades, lobotomies – now considered to
                    be devastating experimental procedures on the brain
                    – were a common way of treating psychiatric
                    patients. Cutting away vital connections in the
                    brain, usually associated with emotion, was
                    considered such an effective “cure” for mental
                    illness that by the 1950s it was mainstream.</p>

                  <p>The theory was that people displaying moodiness
                    could be “cured” by no longer being able to
                    express intense feelings associated with
                    schizophrenia, chronic pain and depression.</p>

                  <p>According to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565&amp;ps=rs">National
                    Public Radio</a>, about 50,000 people were subject
                    to lobotomies in the US, most of them between 1949
                    and 1952. <a href="http://soundportraits.org/on-air/my_lobotomy/">The
                    first US case of an ice-pick lobotomy was carried
                    out on a housewife, Sallie Ionesco, to quieten her
                    down</a> and make her less emotional. The ice-pick
                    procedure involved giving people brutal electric
                    shocks until they passed out, before hammering a
                    tool resembling an ice-pick through the top of the
                    eye socket.</p>

                  <p>We now know Ionesco was likely suffering from
                    depression and would today be prescribed
                    counselling and/or medication. The same could be
                    said for the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/13/eunice-kennedy-shriver-rosemary-kennedy">‘forgotten’
                    Kennedy, Rosemary</a>, who underwent the operation
                    in 1941 and was left largely paralysed and unable
                    to speak.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Tobacco</strong></h2>

                  <p>In this era of banning smoking in outdoor dining
                    areas, and with many young people unable to
                    remember a time when smoking was allowed indoors,
                    it may be hard to believe that tobacco was once
                    doctor-approved.</p>

                  <p>“As ad campaigns featuring physicians developed
                    through the early 1950s, tobacco executives used
                    the doctor image to assure the consumer that their
                    respective brands were safe,” this<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470496/">
                    piece in the American Journal of Public Health</a>
                    says.</p>
                  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="gu-fc-2508b53c-f9a3-4a83-8217-89f5486baad2">

                  </figure>
                  <p>According <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470496/">to
                    research into the history of tobacco
                    advertising</a>; “the last-gasp attempt by a
                    tobacco company to ally itself with physicians came
                    in 1953, when the Lorillard company appealed to
                    physicians as they promoted their new filter
                    cigarette, Kent. These advertisements queried,
                    “Have you tried <em>this</em> experiment,
                    doctor?” and “Why is it, doctor, that one
                    filter cigarette gives so much more protection than
                    any other?”</p>

                  <h2><strong>Homosexuality </strong></h2>

                  <p>According to the American Psychiatric Association
                    and the National Institute of Mental Health,
                    homosexuality was considered a mental illness up
                    until 1973.</p>

                  <p>More enlightened attitudes came too late for many
                    people who had to endure malpractice at the hands
                    of the medical establishment and widespread
                    discrimination in general.</p>

                  <p>Gay people were often institutionalised. The
                    Australian spy agency, <a href="http://www.illawarraqinfo.com/page17.htm">ASIO,
                    kept files on known homosexuals</a> in case they
                    were communist sympathisers.</p>

                  <p><a href="http://www.dailylife.com.au/health-and-fitness/dl-wellbeing/homophobia-in-our-healthcare-system-20130620-2ok5w.html">Homophobia
                    still exists</a> in our healthcare system. <a href="http://pubs.e-contentmanagement.com/doi/pdf/10.5172/conu.2013.44.1.120">This
                    study from just last year</a> described the health
                    system as harsh towards lesbians and often unable
                    to meet their needs.</p>

                  <p>Although the idea that that gay people need to be
                    cured is considered extreme, many <a href="http://www.dailylife.com.au/health-and-fitness/dl-wellbeing/the-dangers-of-gay-cure-20120911-25pwk.html">continue
                    to be forced into pseudo-scientific “treatment”
                    programs</a> aimed at curing them of their
                    homosexuality. The Republican party in Texas <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/06/texas-republicans-gay-conversion-therapy">recently
                    considered adopting “reparative therapy”
                    </a>for gays.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Dexedrine</strong></h2>

                  <p>Pregnant women have suffered through some of the
                    most unscientific applications of drugs in history.
                    The belief that they should gain as little weight
                    as possible throughout their pregnancy led to them
                    being prescribed the amphetamine, <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74P_4zHH1Wo/USq9by5BXlI/AAAAAAAAANs/7eoE5E3QHag/s1600/dexedrine+ad+(Smith+Kline).jpg">Dexedrine,
                    in order to suppress their appetite throughout the
                    50s and 60s.</a></p>

                  <p>The drug is most commonly used now to treat
                    attention deficit disorder in adults and children.</p>

                  <p>Weight gain of more than just a few kilograms was
                    seen as something to be concerned about and a
                    possible sign of swelling or pre-eclampsia.</p>

                  <p><a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55h_healthy_eating_during_pregnancy.pdf">Steady
                    weight gain during pregnancy is now regarded as
                    normal</a>. In fact, not gaining enough weight can
                    lead to complications including pre-term delivery
                    and delivering an underweight baby. There are also
                    much better tests to detect complications such as
                    pre-eclampsia than just looking at weight gain.</p>

                  <p>Poor advice about weight, especially for women, is
                    still widespread, usually at the hands of rogue
                    doctors<a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doctoroz.com%2F&amp;ei=qjvkU9-kMpbd8AXo3IDoBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSevcsrpKmLnsXzaQbGvSXxQntzA&amp;sig2=RSJXI6EoXg49JcT7aAt1YQ&amp;bvm=bv.72676100,d.dGc">
                    like “Dr Oz”</a> and the diet industry. Oz has
                    consistently made claims not backed by science and
                    has been criticised <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2014/06/18/dr-oz-senate-scolding-his-10-most-controversial-weight-loss-supplements/">by
                    US senators</a>.</p>

                  <p>The medical profession, however, is largely on top
                    of the pseudoscience. The beauty of science is that
                    as studies are replicated and data builds, it tends
                    to be self-correcting.</p>

                  <p>Let’s hope Abetz has the gall to be as well.</p>
